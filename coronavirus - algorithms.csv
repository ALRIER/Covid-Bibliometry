All types of industries, vehicle movement, and people's activity suddenly halted, perhaps for the first time in modern history. For a long time, it has been stated in various literature that the increased industrialization and anthropogenic activities in the last two decades polluted the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. Since the industries and people's activities have been shut off for a month or more in many parts of the world, it is expected to show some improvement in the prevailing conditions in the aforementioned spheres of environment. Here, with the help of remote sensing images, this work quantitatively demonstrated the improvement in surface water quality in terms of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the Vembanad Lake, the longest freshwater lake in India. The SPM estimated based on established turbidity algorithm from Landsat-8 OLI images showed that the SPM concentration during the lockdown period decreased by 15.9% on average (range: −10.3% to 36.4%, up to 8 mg/l decrease) compared with the pre-lockdown period. Time series analysis of satellite image collections (April 2013 – April 2020) showed that the SPM quantified for April 2020 is the lowest for 11 out of 20 zones of the Vembanad lake. When compared with preceding years, the percentage decrease in SPM for April 2020 is up to 34% from the previous minima. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Coronavirus; Surface water; Suspended particulate matter; Turbidity; Water quality","Lakes; Remote sensing; Time series analysis; Water quality; Anthropogenic activity; Fresh water lakes; Lake water quality; Remote sensing images; Satellite images; Suspended particulate matters; Vehicle movements; Vembanad lakes; Image enhancement; anthropogenic effect; concentration (composition); COVID-19; disease control; lake water; Landsat; pollution incidence; quarantine; remote sensing; satellite imagery; surface water; viral disease; water quality; India; Kerala; Vembanad Lake; Coronavirus",,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS: 19 K04681","This work was partially supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI Grant Number 19 K04681.",,,,"Akimoto, H., Global air quality and pollution (2003) Science, 302, pp. 1716-1719; Balchand, A., Nair, S., Studies on the fractionation of phosphates in the sediments of a tropical water way (1994) Environ.

The ability to detect disease outbreaks in the early stages is a key component of efficient disease control and prevention. With the increased availability of electronic health-care data and spatial analysis techniques, there is great potential to develop algorithms to enable more effective disease surveillance. The research focuses to develop a transparent user-friendly method to simulate the outbreak data. The paper describes the GIS tools to identify and define the field of investigation which requires consideration of the strengths and limitations of data collection instruments, facility of locational data collection, accuracy of locational data, and pertinent attributes for understanding disease risk. Using such information, it is quite easy for authorities to locate the highly effected area and take appropriate actions in that particular areas. However, GIS techniques, resources, and methods can be used in Pakistan for more effective investigation of vulnerable geographical locations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; GIS; Health; Pakistan","Disease control; Geographic information systems; Location; Control and prevention; Disease outbreaks; Disease surveillance; Electronic healthcare; Geographical locations; Health emergencies; Pertinent attributes; User-friendly methods; Data acquisition; algorithm; COVID-19; disease control; disease prevalence; disease spread; GIS; health care; public health; respiratory disease; spatial analysis; viral disease; Pakistan; Coronavirus",,,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, W., Angel, N., Edson, J., Bibby, K., Bivins, A., O'Brien, J.W., Choi, P.M., Mueller, J.F., First confirmed detection of SARS-CoV-2 in untreated wastewater in Australia: a proof of concept for the wastewater surveillance of COVID-19 in the community (2020) Sci.

The epidemiology is currently opaque, with an unclear understanding of global prevalence, pathology, and genetic characteristics. In this study, Swedish privately-owned dogs with characteristic signs of canine infectious respiratory disease (n = 88) were screened for CRCoV and 13 positive samples (14.7%, 8.4–23.7% [95% confidence interval (CI)]) were further sequenced. Sequenced Swedish CRCoV isolates were highly similar despite being isolated from dogs living in geographically distant locations and sampled across 3 years (2013–2015). This is due to a single introduction into Swedish dogs in approximately 2010, as inferred by time structured phylogeny. Unlike other CRCoVs, there was no evidence of recombination in Swedish CRCoV isolates, further supporting a single introduction. Finally, there were low levels of polymorphisms, in the spike genes. Overall, we demonstrate that there is little diversity of CRCoV which is endemic in Swedish dogs. © 2020 The Authors","Canine infectious respiratory disease; Canine respiratory coronavirus; Coronavirus; CRCoV; Evolutionary genetics; Kennel cough","algorithm; animal experiment; Article; canine respiratory coronavirus; controlled study; Coronavirinae; coughing; dog; explanatory variable; genetic recombination; genetic variation; metagenomics; nonhuman; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; priority journal; Sanger sequencing; single nucleotide polymorphism; Sweden; viral genetics; virus isolation",,,,,"221-2012-586

The management of these patients is still evolving. Materials and methods: This is a single-center observational cohort study of critically ill patients infected with COVID-19. Bedside clinicians abstracted daily patient data on history, treatment, and short-term course. We describe management and a proposed severity scale for treatment used in this hospital. Results: 44 patients were enrolled; with incomplete information on 11. Of the 33 studied patients, 91% were male, median age 64; 88% were overweight or obese. 45% were hypertensive, 12% had been taking an ACE-inhibitor. Noninvasive ventilation was performed on 39% of patients for part or all or their ICU stay with no provider infection. Most patients received antibiotics for pneumonia. Patients also received lopinivir/ritonavir (82%), hydroxychloroquine (79%), and tocilizumab (12%) according to this treatment algorithm. Nine of 10 patients survived their ICU course and were transferred to the floor, with one dying in the ICU. Conclusions: ICU patients with COVID-19 frequently have hypertension. Many could be managed with noninvasive ventilation, despite the risk of aerosolization. The use of a severity scale augmented clinician management. © 2020 The Authors","COVID-19; Novel coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2","antibiotic agent; carbapenem; cephalosporin; dexamethasone; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; macrolide; oxygen; penicillin derivative; tocilizumab; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; anamnesis; Article; blood oxygen tension; Brescia Respiratory COVID Severity Scale; clinical article; clinical feature; cohort analysis; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; critically ill patient; disease severity; disease severity assessment; female; human; hypertension; intensive care unit; Italy; male; medical record; middle aged; mortality; noninvasive ventilation; obesity; observational study; patient care; patient transport; pneumonia; positive end expiratory pressure; SARS-related coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; survival rate; treatment outcome",,"carbapenem, 83200-96-8; cephalosporin, 11111-12-9; dexamethasone, 50-02-2; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; oxygen, 7782-44-7; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,,,"Medicine SoCC, United States resource availability for COVID-19 (2020), https://sccm.org/Blog/March-2020/United-States-Resource-Availability-for-COVID-19?_zs=jxpjd1&_zl=w9pb6; (2020), Intensiva SIdAAReT.

We report a new methodology, the Patient Information Based Algorithm (PIBA), for estimating the death rate of a disease in real-time using publicly available data collected during an outbreak. PIBA estimated the death rate based on data of the patients in Wuhan and then in other cities throughout China. The estimated days from hospital admission to death was 13 (standard deviation (SD), 6 days). The death rates based on PIBA were used to predict the daily numbers of deaths since the week of February 25, 2020, in China overall, Hubei province, Wuhan city, and the rest of the country except Hubei province. The death rate of COVID-19 ranges from 0.75% to 3% and may decrease in the future. The results showed that the real death numbers had fallen into the predicted ranges. In addition, using the preliminary data from China, the PIBA method was successfully used to estimate the death rate and predict the death numbers of the Korean population. In conclusion, PIBA can be used to efficiently estimate the death rate of a new infectious disease in real-time and to predict future deaths.

As of 8 April 2020, 22,073 infection cases of COVID-19 among healthcare workers from 52 countries had been reported to WHO. COVID-19 has strong infectivity, high transmission speeds, and causes serious infection among healthcare worker. Burns are an acute-care condition, and burn treatment needs to be initiated before COVID-19 infection status can be excluded. The key step to infection prevention is to identify risk points of infection exposure, strengthen the protection against those risk points, and formulate an appropriate diagnosis and treatment protocol. Following an in-depth study of the latest literature on COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment, we reviewed the protocols surrounding hospitalization of patients with extensive burns (area≥50 %) in our hospital from February 2009 to February 2019 and, in accordance with the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, developed an algorithm for protection during diagnosis and treatment of burns. Therefore, the aspects of medical protection and the diagnosis and treatment of burns appear to be particularly important during the prevention and control of the COVID-19. This algorithm was followed for 4 patients who received emergency treatment in February 2020 and were hospitalized. All healthcare worker were protected according to the three-tiered protective measures, and there was no nosocomial infection. During the COVID-19 epidemic, the early stages of emergency treatment for patients with extensive burns requiring the establishment of venous access for rehydration, endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy, wound treatment, and surgery are the risk points for exposure to infection. The implementation of effective, appropriate-grade protection and formulation of practical treatment protocols can increase protection of healthcare worke and reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection exposure. © 2020","Burns; COVID-19; Epidemic prevention and control; Exposure risk; Healthcare-associated infections; Protection","C reactive protein; D dimer; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; infusion fluid; muscle enzyme; myoglobin; procalcitonin; adolescent; adult; aged; burn; burn patient; central vein; child; coronavirus disease 2019; emergency treatment; endotracheal intubation; epidemic; female; fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction; gene sequence; general anesthesia; hand washing; health care personnel; hospitalization; human; immunoglobulin blood level; infant; infection control; infection prevention; major clinical study; male; middle aged; necrotizing fasciitis; newborn; occupational exposure; pleura effusion; priority journal; protein blood level; pulmonary hypertension; rehydration; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; susceptible population; thorax radiography; tracheostomy; very elderly; virus transmission; wound care",,"C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; immunoglobulin G, 97794-27-9; immunoglobulin M, 9007-85-6; procalcitonin, 56645-65-9",,,"A2017004, A2016108

According to the ACR guidelines issued shortly after this disease was declared a pandemic, radiologists are expected to familiarize themselves with the CT appearance of COVID-19 infection in order to be able to identify specific findings of this entity. This case report discusses the relevant imaging findings of one of the first cases in the mid-western United States. It involves a 60-year-old man who presented with fever, dyspnea, and cough for 1 week and subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. The utility of the noncontrast CT chest in the diagnosis of COVID-19 has been controversial, but there are specific imaging findings that have been increasingly associated with this virus in the appropriate clinical context. The stages of imaging findings in COVID-19 are considered along with the implications of fibrosis throughout the stages.

Methods: The currently available literature was reviewed for microbiologically confirmed infections by 2019-nCoV or COVID-19 at the time of writing (13 February 2020). A literature search was performed using the PubMed database and Cochrane Library. Search terms included ‘novel coronavirus’ or ‘2019-nCoV’ or ‘COVID-19’. Results: Published cases occurred mostly in males (age range, 8–92 years). Cardiovascular, digestive and endocrine system diseases were commonly reported, except previous chronic pulmonary diseases [e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, bronchiectasis] that were surprisingly underreported. Fever was present in all of the case series available, flanked by cough, dyspnoea, myalgia and fatigue. Multiple bilateral lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation or bilateral ground-glass opacities were the main reported radiological features of 2019-nCoV infection, at least in the early phases of the disease. Conclusion: The new 2019-nCoV epidemic is mainly associated with respiratory disease and few extrapulmonary signs. However, there is a low rate of associated pre-existing respiratory co-morbidities. © 2020","2019-nCoV; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Outbreak; Pneumonia; SAR-CoV-2","abnormal laboratory result; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Article; asthma; bronchiectasis; cardiovascular disease; chronic lung disease; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; dyspnea; endocrine disease; epidemic; fever; gastrointestinal disease; heart injury; human; mortality; myalgia; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; thorax radiography",,,,,,,,,,"Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Ren, L., Zhao, J., Hu, Y., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 497-506; https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases, Situation update worldwide; https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/locations-confirmed-cases.html, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The collected data included 33 death cases in Wuhan city of Hubei province during early outbreak as well as confirmed cases and death toll in some specific regions, which were chosen as representatives from the perspective of the coronavirus outbreak in China. Data were copied and pasted onto Excel spreadsheets to perform data analysis. A new methodology, Patient Information Based Algorithm (PIBA) [1], has been adapted to process the data and used to estimate the death rate of COVID-19 in real-time. Assumption is that the number of days from inpatients to death fall into a pattern of normal distribution and the scores in normal distribution can be obtained by observing 33 death cases and analysing the data [2]. We selected 5 scores in normal distribution of these durations as lagging days, which will be used in the following estimation of death rate. We calculated each death rate on accumulative confirmed cases with each lagging day from the current data and then weighted every death rate with its corresponding possibility to obtain the total death rate on each day. While the trendline of these death rate curves meet the curve of current ratio between accumulative death cases and confirmed cases at some points in the near future, we considered that these intersections are within the range of real death rates. Six tables were presented to illustrate the PIBA method using data from China and South Korea.

The proposed chain reactions target the complementary DNA (cDNA) of SARS–CoV-2, with loci corresponding to gold-standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) loci. Four hybridization chain reaction reactions are demonstrated herein, targeting N1/N2/N3 loci and human RNase P. The design of the hybridization chain reaction, herein, is assisted with an algorithm. The algorithm helps to search target sequences with low local secondary structure and high hybridization efficiency. The loop domain of the fuel hairpin molecule H1 and H2, which are the tunable segments in such reactions, are used as an optimization parameter to improve the hybridization efficiency of the chain reaction. The algorithm-derived HCR reactions were validated with gel electrophoresis. All proposed reactions exhibit a hybridization complex with a molecular mass >1.5k base pairs, which is clear evidence of chain reaction. The hybridization efficiency trend revealed by gel electrophoresis corresponds nicely to the simulated data from the algorithm. The HCR reactions and the corresponding algorithm serve as a basis to further SARS–CoV-2 sensing applications and facilitate better screening strategies for the prevention of on-going pandemics. © 2020 by the authors.

This means that AI-driven tools help identify COVID-19 outbreaks as well as forecast their nature of spread across the globe. However, unlike other healthcare issues, for COVID-19, to detect COVID-19, AI-driven tools are expected to have active learning-based cross-population train/test models that employs multitudinal and multimodal data, which is the primary purpose of the paper. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Active learning; Artificial intelligence; COVID-19; Cross-population train/test models; Machine learning; Multitudinal and multimodal data","active learning; Article; artificial intelligence; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; cross population train; data analysis; epidemic; human; machine learning; medical informatics; nonhuman; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus detection; virus diagnosis; virus pneumonia; algorithm; Coronavirus infection; decision making; epidemic; forecasting; health care delivery; virus pneumonia; COVID-19; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Coronavirus Infections; Decision Making; Delivery of Health Care; Disease Outbreaks; Forecasting; Humans; Machine Learning; Pneumonia, Viral",,"COVID-19",,,,,,,,"Wu, F., Zhao, S., Yu, B., Chen, Y.M., Wang, W., Song, Z.G., Hu, Y., Zhang, Y.Z., A new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in china (2020) Nature, 44 (59), pp. 265-269; (2020) Public Health Response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak – United States, , February 24; Chen, N., Zhou, M., Dong, X., Qu, J., Gong, F., Han, Y., Qiu, Y., Zhang, L., Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in wuhan, china: A descriptive study (2020) The Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 507-513. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/; (2020) Report, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation Report – 49, , https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200229-sitrep-40-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=849d0665_2, accessed March 09, 2020; Wu, Z., McGoogan, J.M., Characteristics of and important lessons from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: Summary of a report of 72,314 cases from the Chinese center for disease control and prevention (2020) JAMA; (2020) The WHO Declares Public Health Emergency for Novel Coronavirus, , https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/924596, January 30; Long, J.B., Ehrenfeld, J.M., The role of augmented intelligence (ai) in detecting and preventing the spread of novel coronavirus (2020) Journal of Medical Systems, 44; Paules, C.I., Marston, H.D., Fauci, A.S., Coronavirus infections – more than just the common cold (2020) JAMA, 323 (8), pp. 707-708; Drosten, C., Gunther, S., Identification of a novel corona virus in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003) N Engl J Med, 348, pp. 1967-1976; Peiris, J., Lai, S., Poon, L., Guan, Y., Yam, L., Lim, W., Nicholls, J., Yuen, K., Coronavirus as a possible cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003) The Lancet, 361 (9366); Song, Z., Xu, Y., Bao, L., Zhang, L., Yu, P., Qu, Y., Zhu, H., Qin, C., From sars to mers, thrusting coronaviruses into the spotlight (2019) Viruses, 11 (1). , https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/11/1/59; de Wit, E., van Doremalen, N., Falzarano, D., Munster, V.J., Sarsandmers: Recentinsights into emerging coronaviruses (2016) Nature Reviews Microbiology, 14 (8), pp. 523-534; Sammut, C., Webb, G.I., (2017) Encyclopedia of Machine Learning and Data Mining, , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4899-7687-1, Springer; Chen, J., Wu, L., Zhang, J., Zhang, L., Gong, D., Zhao, Y., Hu, S., Yu, H., (2020) Deep Learning-Based Model for Detecting 2019 Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia on High-Resolution Computed Tomography: A Prospective Study.

This gap will increase with the current pandemic due to COVID-19. AIM: To evaluate the current availability of digital health tools for the care of people with epilepsy according to the world medical literature and their use during said pandemic. DEVELOPMENT: We reviewed the publications in scientific journals in the last decade that had as their main topic the use of digital health tools or telemedicine focused on the care of patients with epilepsy, including 4 months after the national quarantines due to the appearance of the virus SARS-CoV-2. Seventeen publications were found on the use of telemedicine focused on epilepsy. The most widely used tools internationally are online platforms, followed by mobile applications, videoconferences, epileptic seizure capture systems, checklists, algorithms for understanding medical data, phone calls, tele-encephalography and text messages. None was published during the COVID-19 current pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is little literature on the use of digital health tools focused on epilepsy, there are several that can be used to fight the attention gap, especially in this global pandemic by COVID-19 that forces quarantines of people and communities for long periods. It is necessary to remove barriers and facilitate patient access to these new information technologies.TITLE: Herramientas de salud digital para superar la brecha de atención en epilepsia antes, durante y después de la pandemia de COVID-19. Introducción. La epilepsia es un trastorno neurológico crónico común que afecta alrededor de 50 millones de personas en el mundo y abunda la bibliografía sobre la brecha de atención en salud a este sector de la población. Dicha brecha aumentará con la pandemia actual de COVID-19. Objetivo. Evaluar la disponibilidad actual de herramientas de salud digital para la atención a personas con epilepsia según la literatura médica mundial y su uso durante dicha pandemia. Desarrollo. Se hizo una revisión de las publicaciones en revistas científicas en la última década que tuvieran como tema principal el uso de herramientas de salud digital o telemedicina enfocada a la atención de los pacientes con epilepsia, incluyendo cuatro meses después de las cuarentenas nacionales por la aparición del virus SARS-CoV-2. Se encontraron 17 publicaciones sobre el uso de telemedicina enfocada a la epilepsia. Las herramientas más utilizadas internacionalmente son las plataformas en línea, seguidas de las aplicaciones móviles, videoconferencias, sistemas de captación de crisis epilépticas, listas de verificación, algoritmos de comprensión de datos médicos, llamadas telefónicas, telelectroencefalografía y mensajes de texto. Ninguna se publicó durante la presente pandemia. Conclusiones.

Material and method: Recommendations based on the consensus conference model. Results: In the case of a COVID-19 positive patient, surgical management should be postponed for at least 15 days. For cervical cancer, the place of surgery must be re-evaluated in relation to radiotherapy and Radio-Chemotherapy-Concomitant and the value of lymph node staging surgeries must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. For advanced ovarian cancers, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy should be favored even if primary cytoreduction surgery could be envisaged. It is lawful not to offer hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during a COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of patients who must undergo interval surgery, it is possible to continue the chemotherapy and to offer surgery after 6 cycles of chemotherapy. For early stage endometrial cancer, in case of low and intermediate preoperative ESMO risk, hysterectomy with bilateral annexectomy associated with a sentinel lymph node procedure should be favored. It is possible to consider postponing surgery for 1 to 2 months in low-risk endometrial cancers (FIGO Ia stage on MRI and grade 1-2 endometrioid cancer on endometrial biopsy). For high ESMO risk, it ispossible to favor the MSKCC algorithm (combining PET-CT and sentinel lymph node biopsy) in order to omit pelvic and lumbar-aortic lymphadenectomies. Conclusion: During COVID-19 pandemic, patients suffering from cancer should not lose life chance, while limiting the risks associated with the virus. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","COVID-19; Guideline; Gynaecological cancer; Management","antineoplastic agent; adjuvant therapy; advanced cancer; Article; bilateral annexectomy; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer staging; cancer surgery; chemoradiotherapy; consensus; coronavirus disease 2019; cytoreductive surgery; early cancer; endometrium cancer; female; female genital tract cancer; gynecologic surgery; human; hysterectomy; low risk patient; lumbar lymph node; lymph node; multiple cycle treatment; neoadjuvant chemotherapy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; ovary cancer; pandemic; paraaortic lymph node; pelvis lymphadenectomy; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; practice guideline; sentinel lymph node; sentinel lymph node biopsy; uterine cervix cancer",,,,,,,,,,,"Lavoue, V.; Service de gynécologie, CHU hôpital Sud, 16, boulevard de Bulgarie, France; email: Vincent.lavoue@gmail.com",,,"Elsevier Masson SAS",,,,,24687197,,,"32222433","English; French","Gynecol.

Non-invasive monitoring is also extremely necessary in situations where it is difficult to use complicated wired connections, such as ECG monitoring for infants, burn victims or during rescue missions when people are buried during building collapses/earthquakes. Due to the unique characteristics such as higher penetration capabilities, extremely precise ranging, low power requirement, low cost, simple hardware and robustness to multipath interferences, Impulse Radio Ultra Wideband (IR-UWB) technology is appropriate for non-invasive medical applications. IR-UWB sensors detect the macro as well as micro movement inside the human body due to its fine range resolution. The two vital signs, i.e., respiration rate and heart rate, can be measured by IR-UWB radar by measuring the change in the magnitude of signal due to displacement caused by human lungs, heart during respiration and heart beating. This paper reviews recent advances in IR- UWB radar sensor design for healthcare, such as vital signs measurements of a stationary human, vitals of a non-stationary human, vital signs of people in a vehicle, through the wall vitals measurement, neonate's health monitoring, fall detection, sleep monitoring and medical imaging. Although we have covered many topics related to health monitoring using IR-UWB, this paper is mainly focused on signal processing techniques for measurement of vital signs, i.e., respiration and heart rate monitoring.","algorithm; fall detection; heart rate; IR-UWB radar; motion detection; respiration rate; sleep monitoring; vital signs","breathing rate; Coronavirus infection; devices; heart rate; human; pandemic; physiologic monitoring; procedures; radiofrequency radiation; signal processing; telecommunication; telemedicine; theoretical model; virus pneumonia; Coronavirus Infections; Heart Rate; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Monitoring, Physiologic; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Radar; Radio Waves; Respiratory Rate; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Telemedicine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,14248220,,,"32349382","English","Sensors (Basel)",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084170606

This study aims to evaluate the knowledge of anesthesiology specialists and residents in Turkey about COVID-19 and their attitudes toward the strategies and application methods to be used for a suspected/confirmed COVID-19 case that needs to be operated on or followed up in an intensive care unit, as well as to raise awareness about this issue. Methods: This descriptive study comprised anesthesiology specialists and residents working in various health institutions in Turkey. The data used in this study were obtained online between March 13, 2020 and March 25, 2020 through the website SurveyMonkey (SurveyMonkey, San Mateo, CA) by using a survey form. We contacted members of the Turkish Anaesthesiology and Reanimation Society through the social media platforms Twitter, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp, as well as through their e-mail addresses and invited them to participate in the study. Those who agreed to participate responded to the aforementioned survey. We used SPSS 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY) to analyze the survey data statistically. Results: A total of 346 anesthesiology specialists and residents participated in the study. Although the majority of the participants exhibited the correct attitudes toward airway management, research assistants with little professional experience were observed to be undecided or had the tendency to make incorrect decisions. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly worldwide. The incidence of COVID-19 cases is increasing daily, and this disease can cause patient death. Anesthesiology specialists and residents who perform emergency operations on these patients in settings other than intensive care units should follow simple and easy-to-understand algorithms to ensure safety. The provision of theoretical and practical training to healthcare providers before they meet patients will help ensure patient-healthcare provider safety and prevent panic, which can cause distress among healthcare providers.","anesthesiology; COVID-19; intensive care",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,15578674,,,"32275463","English","Surg Infect (Larchmt)",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083865804

Our objective was to evaluate the reality and perceptions about personal safety among healthcare workers in Latin America. This is a cross-sectional, online survey-based study administered to 936 healthcare professionals in Latin America from 31 March 2020 to 4 April 2020. A 12-item structured questionnaire was developed. A total of 936 healthcare workers completed the online survey. Of them, 899 (95.1%) were physicians, 28 (2.9%) were nurses, and 18 (1.9%) were allied health professionals. Access to protective equipment was as follows: gel hand sanitizer (n = 889; 95%), disposable gloves (n = 853; 91.1%), disposable gowns (n = 630; 67.3%), disposable surgical masks (785; 83.9%), N95 masks (n = 516; 56.1%), and facial protective shields (n = 305; 32.6%). The vast majority (n = 707; 75.5%) had access to personal safety policies and procedures, and 699 (74.7%) participants had access to diagnostic algorithms. On a 1-to-10 Likert scale, the participants expressed limited human resources support (4.92 ± 0.2; mean ± SD), physical integrity protection in the workplace (5.5 ± 0.1; mean ± SD), and support from public health authorities (5.01 ± 0.12; mean ± SD). Healthcare workers in Latin America had limited access to essential PPE and support from healthcare authorities during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 by the authors.

Nowadays, social media has become the main channel through which the public can obtain information and express their opinions and feelings. This study explored public opinion in the early stages of COVID-19 in China by analyzing Sina-Weibo (a Twitter-like microblogging system in China) texts in terms of space, time, and content. Temporal changes within one-hour intervals and the spatial distribution of COVID-19-related Weibo texts were analyzed. Based on the latent Dirichlet allocation model and the random forest algorithm, a topic extraction and classification model was developed to hierarchically identify seven COVID-19-relevant topics and 13 sub-topics from Weibo texts. The results indicate that the number of Weibo texts varied over time for different topics and sub-topics corresponding with the different developmental stages of the event. The spatial distribution of COVID-19-relevant Weibo was mainly concentrated in Wuhan, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration. There is a synchronization between frequent daily discussions on Weibo and the trend of the COVID-19 outbreak in the real world. Public response is very sensitive to the epidemic and significant social events, especially in urban agglomerations with convenient transportation and a large population. The timely dissemination and updating of epidemic-related information and the popularization of such information by the government can contribute to stabilizing public sentiments. However, the surge of public demand and the hysteresis of social support demonstrated that the allocation of medical resources was under enormous pressure in the early stage of the epidemic. It is suggested that the government should strengthen the response in terms of public opinion and epidemic prevention and exert control in key epidemic areas, urban agglomerations, and transboundary areas at the province level. In controlling the crisis, accurate response countermeasures should be formulated following public help demands. The findings can help government and emergency agencies to better understand the public opinion and sentiments towards COVID-19, to accelerate emergency responses, and to support post-disaster management. © 2020 by the authors.

Typically, the individuals are scattered across different locations, and available quarantine vehicles are limited. Therefore, it is challenging to efficiently schedule the vehicles to transfer the individuals to isolated regions to control the spread of the epidemic. In this paper, we formulate such a quarantine vehicle scheduling problem for high-risk individual transfer, which is more difficult than most well-known vehicle routing problems. To efficiently solve this problem, we propose a hybrid algorithm based on the water wave optimization (WWO) metaheuristic and neighborhood search. The metaheuristic uses a small population to rapidly explore the solution space, and the neighborhood search uses a gradual strategy to improve the solution accuracy. Computational results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms several existing algorithms and obtains high-quality solutions on real-world problem instances for high-risk individual transfer in Hangzhou, China, during the peak period of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). © 2020 by the authors.

In the context of the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the ability to deliver timely and efficacious care must be balanced with the risk of infectious exposure to the clinical team. Furthermore, rapid and effective stroke care remains paramount to achieve maximal functional recovery for those needing admission and to triage care appropriately for those who may be presenting with neurological symptoms but have an alternative diagnosis. Methods- Available resources, COVID-19-specific infection prevention and control recommendations, and expert consensus were used to identify clinical screening criteria for patients and provide the required nuanced considerations for the healthcare team, thereby modifying the conventional code stroke processes to achieve a protected designation. Results- A protected code stroke algorithm was developed. Features specific to prenotification and clinical status of the patient were used to define precode screening. These include primary infectious symptoms, clinical, and examination features. A focused framework was then developed with regard to a protected code stroke. We outline the specifics of personal protective equipment use and considerations thereof including aspects of crisis resource management impacting team role designation and human performance factors during a protected code stroke. Conclusions- We introduce the concept of a protected code stroke during a pandemic, as in the case of COVID-19, and provide a framework for key considerations including screening, personal protective equipment, and crisis resource management. These considerations and suggested algorithms can be utilized and adapted for local practice.","algorithms; consensus; COVID-19; pandemics; stroke",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,15244628,,,"32233980","English","Stroke",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083250418

Previous studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 is highly homologous to SARS-CoV and infects humans through the binding of the spike protein to ACE2. Here, we have systematically studied the molecular mechanisms of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV by protein-protein docking and MD simulations. It was found that SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 with a higher affinity than SARS-CoV, which may partly explain that SARS-CoV-2 is much more infectious than SARS-CoV. In addition, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a significantly lower free energy than that of SARS-CoV, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is more stable and may survive a higher temperature than SARS-CoV. This provides insights into the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 because SARS-like coronaviruses have originated in bats. Our computation also suggested that the RBD-ACE2 binding for SARS-CoV-2 is much more temperature-sensitive than that for SARS-CoV. Thus, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 would decrease its infection ability much faster than SARS-CoV when the temperature rises. These findings would be beneficial for the disease prevention and drug/vaccine development of SARS-CoV-2. © 2020 by the authors.","Coronaviruses; Human infection; MD simulations; Molecular mechanism; Protein docking; SARS-CoV; SARS-CoV-2","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; virus spike protein; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; protein binding; spike glycoprotein, SARS-CoV; algorithm; Article; binding affinity; computer model; computer simulation; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; nonhuman; protein expression; protein structure; SARS coronavirus; sequence alignment; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus replication; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; evolution; heat; human; metabolism; molecular dynamics; pandemic; protein stability; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Biological Evolution; Coronavirus Infections; Hot Temperature; Humans; Molecular Docking Simulation; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Protein Binding; Protein Stability; SARS Virus; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus",,"dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, 9015-82-1; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; spike glycoprotein, SARS-CoV",,,"Huazhong University of Science and Technology, HUST

SARS-CoV-2 with potential origin of bat is still circulating in China. In this study, a prediction model is proposed to evaluate the infection risk of non-human-origin coronavirus for early warning. Methods: The spike protein sequences of 2666 coronaviruses were collected from 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR) Database of China National Genomics Data Center on Jan 29, 2020. A total of 507 human-origin viruses were regarded as positive samples, whereas 2159 non-human-origin viruses were regarded as negative. To capture the key information of the spike protein, three feature encoding algorithms (amino acid composition, AAC; parallel correlation-based pseudo-amino-acid composition, PC-PseAAC and G-gap dipeptide composition, GGAP) were used to train 41 random forest models. The optimal feature with the best performance was identified by the multidimensional scaling method, which was used to explore the pattern of human coronavirus. Results: The 10-fold cross-validation results showed that well performance was achieved with the use of the GGAP (g = 3) feature. The predictive model achieved the maximum ACC of 98.18% coupled with the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.9638. Seven clusters for human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) were found. The cluster for SARS-CoV-2 was very close to that for SARS-CoV, which suggests that both of viruses have the same human receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme II). The big gap in the distance curve suggests that the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is not clear and further surveillance in the field should be made continuously. The smooth distance curve for SARS-CoV suggests that its close relatives still exist in nature and public health is challenged as usual. Conclusions: The optimal feature (GGAP, g = 3) performed well in terms of predicting infection risk and could be used to explore the evolutionary dynamic in a simple, fast and large-scale manner. The study may be beneficial for the surveillance of the genome mutation of coronavirus in the field. © 2020 The Author(s).","Coronavirus; Cross-species infection; Machine learning; Spike protein","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; virus spike protein; amino acid; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin-producing serum enzyme II; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; proteinase; virus receptor; amino acid composition; amino acid sequence; Article; correlation coefficient; evolution; false positive result; feature selection algorithm; infection risk; machine learning; mathematical model; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; multidimensional scaling; prediction; priority journal; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; SARS coronavirus; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus transmission; algorithm; animal; Betacoronavirus; China; Chlorocebus aethiops; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; disease carrier; genetics; genome; human; immunology; isolation and purification; metabolism; pandemic; phylogeny; risk assessment; virology; virus genome; virus pneumonia; Algorithms; Amino Acids; Animals; Betacoronavirus; China; Chlorocebus aethiops; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Reservoirs; Endopeptidases; Genome; Genome, Viral; Humans; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Phylogeny; Pneumonia, Viral; Receptors, Virus; Risk Assessment; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus",,"amino acid, 65072-01-7; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, 9015-82-1; proteinase, 9001-92-7; Amino Acids; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin-producing serum enzyme II; Endopeptidases; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Receptors, Virus; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus",,,"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province: 2018A030313380

METHODS: This retrospective case-control study involves subjects (7 to 98 years) presenting at the designated national outbreak screening centre and tertiary care hospital in Singapore for SARS-CoV-2 testing from January 26 to February 16, 2020. COVID-19 status was confirmed by PCR testing of sputum, nasopharyngeal swabs or throat swabs. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and exposure-risk variables ascertainable at presentation were analyzed to develop an algorithm for estimating the risk of COVID-19. Model development used Akaike's information criterion in a stepwise fashion to build logistic regression models, which were then translated into prediction scores. Performance was measured using receiver operating characteristics curves, adjusting for over-confidence using leave-out-one cross validation. RESULTS: The study population included 788 subjects, of whom 54 (6.9%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 734 (93.1%) were SARS-CoV-2 negative. The median age was 34 years and 407 (51.7%) were female. Using leave-out-one cross validation, all the models incorporating clinical tests (Models 1, 2 and 3) performed well with areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.91, 0.88 and 0.88 respectively. In comparison, Model 4 had an AUC of 0.65. CONCLUSIONS: Rapidly ascertainable clinical and laboratory data could identify individuals at high risk of COVID-19 and enable prioritization of PCR-testing and containment efforts. Basic laboratory test results were crucial to prediction models. © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.

There is no specific medicine available for treating the disease. Luckily, traditional Chinese medicine has played a positive role in the fighting against COVID-19. In this paper, We collected and sorted the prescriptions of modern Chinese medicine for COVID-19 released by national government, different provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, as well as online databases, such as CNKI, WanFang medical network, and VIP database. These prescriptions were combined with the inheritance of traditional Chinese medicine auxiliary V2.5, and the complex system entropy clustering method was used to determine the association rules and frequency of single drug and drug combination in the prescription. In the end, 96 effective prescriptions were included. Among them, the four properties were mainly concentrated in temperature, cold and level, the five tastes were mainly concentrated in bitter, hot and sweet, and the meridians were mainly concentrated in lung, stomach and spleen. The high-frequency drugs were Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Gypsum Fibrosum, etc., and the high-frequency combinations are Gypsum Fibrosum-Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Gypsum Fibrosum-Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Armeniacae Semen Amarum-Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, the core combinations are Lepidii Semen-Armeniacae Semen Amarum-Gypsum Fibrosum, Pogostemonis Herba-Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens-Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, Ophiopogonis Radix-Armeniacae Semen Amarum-Scutellariae Radix and so on. Form new prescriptions Lepidii Semen, Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Gypsum Fibrosum, Pogostemonis Herba, Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex. Ophiopogonis Radix, Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Scutellariae Radix, Schisandrae Sphenantherae Fructus, Panacis Quinquefolii Radix. From the medicinal properties to high-frequency drugs and new prescriptions, it could be seen that the overall treatment of COVID-19 by traditional Chinese medicine was to strengthen body resistance, eliminate pathogenic factors, and give attention to Qi and Yin.","2019-nCoV; association rules; clustering algorithm; coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19); data mining","herbaceous agent; Betacoronavirus; Chinese medicine; Coronavirus infection; data mining; human; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Data Mining; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Humans; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",,"Drugs, Chinese Herbal",,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,10015302,,,"32281332","Chinese","Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083316317

The number of confirmed cases is increasing daily and reached 34,598 on 8 February 2020. In the current study, we present a new forecasting model to estimate and forecast the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the upcoming ten days based on the previously confirmed cases recorded in China. The proposed model is an improved adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) using an enhanced flower pollination algorithm (FPA) by using the salp swarm algorithm (SSA). In general, SSA is employed to improve FPA to avoid its drawbacks (i.e., getting trapped at the local optima). The main idea of the proposed model, called FPASSA-ANFIS, is to improve the performance of ANFIS by determining the parameters of ANFIS using FPASSA. The FPASSA-ANFIS model is evaluated using theWorld Health Organization (WHO) official data of the outbreak of the COVID-19 to forecast the confirmed cases of the upcoming ten days. More so, the FPASSA-ANFIS model is compared to several existing models, and it showed better performance in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE), Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE), coefficient of determination (R2), and computing time. Furthermore, we tested the proposed model using two different datasets of weekly influenza confirmed cases in two countries, namely the USA and China. The outcomes also showed good performances. © 2020 by the authors.","adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS); COVID-19; flower pollination algorithm (FPA); forecasting; salp swarm algorithm (SSA)",,,,,,,,,,,"Chen, Y., Liu, Q., Guo, D., Emerging coronaviruses: Genome structure, replication, and pathogenesis (2020) J.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to be important regulators during virus infection. Here, we describe a comprehensive transcriptome profile of lncRNA in PDCoV-infected swine testicular (ST) cells. In total, 1,308 annotated and 1,190 novel lncRNA candidate sequences were identified. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that these lncRNAs might be involved in numerous biological processes. Clustering analysis of differentially expressed lncRNAs showed that 454 annotated and 376 novel lncRNAs were regulated after PDCoV infection. Furthermore, we constructed a lncRNA-protein-coding gene co-expression interaction network. The KEGG analysis of the co-expressed genes showed that these differentially expressed lncRNAs were enriched in pathways related to metabolism and TNF signaling. Our study provided comprehensive information about lncRNAs that would be a useful resource for studying the pathogenesis of and designing antiviral therapy for PDCoV infection. © Copyright © 2020 Liu, Wang, Du, Li, Yu, Jin, Yan, Zhou and Gu.","lncRNA; metabolic pathway; PDCoV infection; RNA-seq; TNF","CXCL2 chemokine; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 6; long untranslated RNA; macrophage inflammatory protein 3alpha; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; RANTES; transcriptome; animal cell; Article; cell culture; clustering algorithm; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; down regulation; exon; gene cluster; gene expression; gene ontology; genetic conservation; genome analysis; high throughput sequencing; IPEC-J2 cell line; microarray analysis; molecular genetics; mouse; nonhuman; Porcine deltacoronavirus; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; signal transduction; testicular cell line; upregulation; virus characterization; virus gene",,"gamma interferon inducible protein 10, 97741-20-3; macrophage inflammatory protein 3alpha, 177404-38-5; mitogen activated protein kinase 3, 137632-07-6",,,"2016YFD0500102","This work was supported by the National Key Research & Development Program of China (2016YFD0500102).",,,,"Ajayi, T., Dara, R., Misener, M., Pasma, T., Moser, L., Poljak, Z., Herd-level prevalence and incidence of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) in swine herds in Ontario, Canada (2018) Transbound.

The newly discovered coronavirus is similar to some β-coronaviruses found in bats but different from previously known SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. High sequence identities and similarities between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV were found. In this study, we searched the homologous templates of all nonstructural and structural proteins of 2019-nCoV. Among the nonstructural proteins, the leader protein (nsp1), the papain-like protease (nsp3), the nsp4, the 3C-like protease (nsp5), the nsp7, the nsp8, the nsp9, the nsp10, the RNA-directed RNA polymerase (nsp12), the helicase (nsp13), the guanine-N7 methyltransferase (nsp14), the uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (nsp15), the 2'-O-methyltransferase (nsp16), and the ORF7a protein could be built on the basis of homology templates. Among the structural proteins, the spike protein (S-protein), the envelope protein (E-protein), and the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) can be constructed based on the crystal structures of the proteins from SARS-CoV. It is known that PL-Pro, 3CL-Pro, and RdRp are important targets for design antiviral drugs against 2019-nCoV. And S protein is a critical target candidate for inhibitor screening or vaccine design against 2019-nCoV because coronavirus replication is initiated by the binding of S protein to cell surface receptors. It is believed that these proteins should be useful for further structure-based virtual screening and related computer-aided drug development and vaccine design. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","2019-nCoV; BLAST algorithm; CLUSTAL analysis; coronavirus; homology modeling; MERS-CoV; SARS-CoV; sequence alignment",,,,,,,,,,,"Drosten, C., Günther, S., Preiser, W., Identification of a novel coronavirus in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003) New Engl J Med, 348, pp. 1967-1976; Zaki, A.M., van Boheemen, S., Bestebroer, T.M., Osterhaus, A.D., Fouchier, R.A., Isolation of a novel coronavirus from a man with pneumonia in Saudi Arabia (2012) New Engl J Med, 367, pp. 1814-1820; Huang, C.L., Wang, Y.M., Li, X.W., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 497-506; Chan, J.F.W., Yuan, S.F., Kok, K.H., A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 514-523; Wang, C., Horby, P.W., Hayden, F.G., Gao, G.F., A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 470-473; Lu, R.J., Zhao, X., Li, J., Genomic characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding (2020) Lancet, 395 (10224), pp. 565-574; Chen, N.S., Zhou, M., Dong, X., Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 507-513; Zhu, N., Zhang, D.Y., Wang, W.L., A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019 (2020) New Engl J Med, 382, pp. 727-733; Rubin, E.J., Baden, L.R., Morrissey, S., Campion, E.W., Medical journals and the 2019-nCoV outbreak (2020) New Engl J Med, 382, p. 866; Munster, V.J., Koopmans, M., van Doremalen, N., van Riel, D., de Wit, E., A novel coronavirus emerging in China–key questions for impact assessment (2020) New Engl J Med, 382, pp. 692-694; Perlman, S., Another decade, another coronavirus (2020) New Engl J Med, 382, pp. 760-762; Li, Q., Guan, X.H., Wu, P., Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus–infected pneumonia (2020) New Engl J Med, 382, pp. 1199-1207. , https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2001316; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN988713; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN994468; Xu, X.T., Chen, P., Wang, J.F., Evolution of the novel coronavirus from the ongoing Wuhan outbreak and modeling of its spike protein for risk of human transmission (2020) Sci China Life Sci, 63, pp. 457-460; Cohen, J., Can an anti-HIV combination or other existing drugs outwit the new coronavirus?

A large proportion of positive patients require hospitalization, while 5-6% of them may need more aggressive therapies in intensive care. Most governments have recommended social separation and severe measures of prevention of further spreading of the epidemic. Because hemodialysis (HD) patients need to access hospital and dialysis center facilities 3 times a week, this category of patients requires special attention. In this editorial, we tried to summarize the experience of our centers that hopefully may contribute to help other centers and colleagues that are facing the coming wave of the epidemic. Special algorithms for COVID-19 spreading in the dialysis population, recommendations for isolation and preventive measures in positive HD patients, and finally directions to manage logistics and personnel are reported. These recommendations should be considered neither universal nor absolute. Instead, they require local adjustments based on geographic location, cultural and social environments, and level of available resources. © 2020 S.

Nevertheless, there are some predicted and unpredicted problems that epidemic diseases are real and complex problems. Hence, in this research work, a serious challenge in the sustainable development process was investigated using the classification of confirmed cases of COVID-19 (new version of Coronavirus) as one of the epidemic diseases. Hence, binary classification modeling was used by the group method of data handling (GMDH) type of neural network as one of the artificial intelligence methods. For this purpose, the Hubei province in China was selected as a case study to construct the proposed model, and some important factors, namely maximum, minimum, and average daily temperature, the density of a city, relative humidity, and wind speed, were considered as the input dataset, and the number of confirmed cases was selected as the output dataset for 30 days. The proposed binary classification model provides higher performance capacity in predicting the confirmed cases. In addition, regression analysis has been done and the trend of confirmed cases compared with the fluctuations of daily weather parameters (wind, humidity, and average temperature). The results demonstrated that the relative humidity and maximum daily temperature had the highest impact on the confirmed cases. The relative humidity in the main case study, with an average of 77.9%, affected positively, and maximum daily temperature, with an average of 15.4 ◦C, affected negatively, the confirmed cases. © 2020 by the authors.

Considering its high specificity but low sensitivity, a modified Grunow–Finke tool (mGFT) has been developed with improved sensitivity. The mGFT has been validated against some past disease outbreaks, but it has not been applied to ongoing outbreaks. This study is aimed to score the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia using both the original GFT and mGFT. The publicly available data on human cases of MERS-CoV infections reported in Saudi Arabia (2012–2018) were sourced from the FluTrackers, World Health Organization, Saudi Ministry of Health, and published literature associated with MERS outbreaks investigations. The risk assessment of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia was analyzed using the original GFT and mGFT criteria, algorithms, and thresholds. The scoring points for each criterion were determined by three researchers to minimize the subjectivity. The results showed 40 points of total possible 54 points using the original GFT (likelihood: 74%), and 40 points of a total possible 60 points (likelihood: 67%) using the mGFT, both tools indicating a high likelihood that human MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia is unnatural in origin. The findings simply flag unusual patterns in this outbreak, but do not prove unnatural etiology. Proof of bioattacks can only be obtained by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. This study demonstrated the value and flexibility of the mGFT in assessing and predicting the risk for an ongoing outbreak with simple criteria. © 2020 Society for Risk Analysis","Algorithm; bioterrorism; MERS-CoV; outbreak investigation; risk analysis; scoring system; unnatural epidemic","Algorithms; Bioterrorism; Risk analysis; Disease outbreaks; Intelligence agencies; MERS-CoV; outbreak investigation; Risk analysis tools; Scoring systems; unnatural epidemic; World Health Organization; Risk assessment",,,,,"Infrastructure Security and Energy Restoration, ISER: APP1107393

According to the latest report (18-February-2020), it has infected more than 72,000 people globally and led to deaths of more than 1,016 people in China. Methods: The 2019 novel coronavirus proteome was aligned to a curated database of viral immunogenic peptides. The immunogenicity of detected peptides and their binding potential to HLA alleles was predicted by immunogenicity predictive models and NetMHCpan 4.0. Results: We report in silico identification of a comprehensive list of immunogenic peptides that can be used as potential targets for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) vaccine development. First, we found 28 nCoV peptides identical to Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS CoV) that have previously been characterized immunogenic by T cell assays. Second, we identified 48 nCoV peptides having a high degree of similarity with immunogenic peptides deposited in The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). Lastly, we conducted a de novo search of 2019-nCoV 9-mer peptides that i) bind to common HLA alleles in Chinese and European population and ii) have T Cell Receptor (TCR) recognition potential by positional weight matrices and a recently developed immunogenicity algorithm, iPred, and identified in total 63 peptides with a high immunogenicity potential.

COVID-19 has created havoc, and scientists and physicians are urged to test the efficiency and safety of drugs used to treat this disease. In such a pandemic situation, various steps have been taken by the government to control and prevent the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2). This pandemic situation has forced scientists to rework strategies to combat infectious diseases through drugs, treatment, and control measures. COVID-19 treatment requires both limiting viral multiplication and neutralizing tissue damage induced by an inappropriate immune reaction. Currently, various diagnostic kits to test for COVID-19 are available, and repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19 has shown to be clinically effective. As the global demand for diagnostics and therapeutics continues to rise, it is essential to rapidly develop various algorithms to successfully identify and contain the virus. This review discusses the updates on specimens/samples, recent efficient diagnostics, and therapeutic approaches to control the disease and repurposed drugs mainly focusing on chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma (CP). More research is required for further understanding of the influence of diagnostics and therapeutic approaches to develop vaccines and drugs for COVID-19.

The first related death occurred on March 17, 2020. Preparedness for the pandemic has been ongoing before the first case was detected. The National Pandemic Plan was published in 2006. The Pandemic Influenza National Preparedness Plan was available after being updated in light of experiences gained during the 2009 Influenza A pandemic. Accordingly, Pandemic Coordination Boards and Operation Centers have been established on the national and provincial levels. This was an adaptable plan to the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). We formed teams to work on a 24/7 basis and established a Scientific Committee at the Public Health Emergency Operation Center within the General Directorate of Public Health. “COVID-19 Risk Assessment”, “COVID-19 Guideline” and “Case Report Form”, regulations of personal protective equipment along with need-based guidelines, treatment algorithms, brochures and related documents have been released. For the case-based follow-up, Public Health Management System (HSYS) is being used. PCR and rapid diagnostic kits are being used to analyze the samples at the central Microbiology Reference Laboratory and the authorized laboratories in several provinces. Various preventive measures were implemented including flight restrictions to certain countries, gradually expanded to suspending all flights and prohibiting the entry of foreign nationals, 14-day isolation and symptom monitoring for those that came from countries under risk. Persons with chronic diseases have been granted an administrative leave, on campus education at schools and activities of public rest and entertainment areas were temporarily suspended. The measures have been implemented for penitentiary institutions, dormitories, nursing homes, public transport and intercity buses, and also weekend curfews are implemented. In accordance with the pandemic plan, actions have been carried out with a multi-sectoral approach, and preventive measures have been implemented to cover the society as a whole. © TÜBİTAK.","Control; COVID-19; COVID-19 pandemic; Preventive measures","coronavirus disease 2019; epidemic; health care personnel; health service; human; hygiene; infection control; infection prevention; information; policy; practice guideline; public health; quarantine; Review; risk assessment; social distance; traffic and transport; Turkey (republic); virus transmission; workplace; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; health care policy; information dissemination; laboratory technique; pandemic; polymerase chain reaction; protective equipment; travel; turkey (bird); virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Guidelines as Topic; Health Policy; Humans; Information Dissemination; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Quarantine; Travel; Turkey",,,,,,,,,,"(2019), https://hsgm.saglik.gov.tr/tr/bulasicihastaliklar-haberler/ulusal-pandemi-hazirlik-plani.html; (2006), https://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2006/08/20060823.htm; (2020) Similarities and Differences – COVID-19 and Influenza [Online], , https://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=15760:similarities-and-differences-covid-&lang=en; (2020) European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, p. 29. , Rapid Risk Assessment: Outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): increased transmission globally – fifth update; (2020), https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports; (2020), https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen; (2020), https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance; (2020), https://covid19bilgi.saglik.gov.tr/tr/; (2020) COVID-19 Algoritmalar [Online], , https://covid19bilgi.saglik.gov.tr/tr/algoritmalar","Özgüler, Z.Ö.; General Directorate of Public Health, Ministry of HealthTurkey; email: zeynepozgemd@gmail.com",,,"Turkiye Klinikleri",,,,,13000144,,TJMEE,"32304192","English","Turk.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the cancellation of many conferences, forcing the scientific community to explore online alternatives. Here, we report on our experiences of organizing an online neuroscience conference, neuromatch, that attracted some 3000 participants and featured two days of talks, debates, panel discussions, and one-on-one meetings facilitated by a matching algorithm. By offering most of the benefits of traditional conferences, several clear advantages, and with fewer of the downsides, we feel that online conferences have the potential to replace many legacy conferences. © 2020, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Pharmacy Special Interest Group Steering Committee aims to provide pharmacy practice management recommendations for how to transition clinical HCT or cellular therapy pharmacy services using telemedicine capabilities in the inpatient and outpatient settings to maintain an equivalent level of clinical practice while minimizing viral spread in a high-risk, immunocompromised population. In addition, the Steering Committee offers clinical management recommendations for COVID-19 in HCT and cellular therapy recipients based on the rapidly developing literature. As the therapeutic and supportive care interventions for COVID-19 expand, collaboration with clinical pharmacy providers is critical to ensure safe administration in HCT recipients. Attention to drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and toxicity, particularly QTc prolongation, warrants close cardiac monitoring and potential cessation of concomitant QTc-prolonging agents. Expanded indications for hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab have already caused stress on the usual supply chain. Detailed prescribing algorithms, decision pathways, and specific patient population stock may be necessary. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged all members of the healthcare team, and we must continue to remain vigilant in providing pharmacy clinical services to one of the most high-risk patient populations while also remaining committed to providing compassionate and safe care for patients undergoing HCT and cellular therapies. © 2020 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","Cellular therapy; Coronavirus; COVID-19; HCT; Pharmacist; Pharmacy",,,,,,"Sanofi Genzyme, Genzyme Corp.

These model predictions have shown a wide range of variations. In our study, we demonstrate that nonidentifiability in model calibrations using the confirmed-case data is the main reason for such wide variations. Using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for model selection, we show that an SIR model performs much better than an SEIR model in representing the information contained in the confirmed-case data. This indicates that predictions using more complex models may not be more reliable compared to using a simpler model. We present our model predictions for the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan after the lockdown and quarantine of the city on January 23, 2020. We also report our results of modeling the impacts of the strict quarantine measures undertaken in the city after February 7 on the time course of the epidemic, and modeling the potential of a second outbreak after the return-to-work in the city. © 2020 The Authors","Bayesian inference; COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan; Model selection; Nonidentifiability; Peak time of epidemic; Quarantine; SIR and SEIR models","2019 novel coronavirus; algorithm; Article; basic reproduction number; Bayes theorem; China; coronavirus disease 2019; disease surveillance; disease transmission; epidemic; human; incidence; mathematical model; maximum likelihood method; model; population size; prediction; public health; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",,,,,"Canada Foundation for Innovation, CFI","Research of MYL is supported in part by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada and Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) .",,,,"Akaike, H., Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle (1973) Second international symposium on information theory, pp. 267-281. , Akademiai Kiado Budapest; Bai, Y., Yao, L., Wei, T., Presumed asymptomatic carrier transmission of COVID-19 (2020) Journal of the American Medical Association, , Published online February 21, 2020; Burnham, K., Anderson, D., Model selection and multimodel inference: A practical information-theoretic approach (2002), Springer-Verlag New York; Chen, M., Shao, Q., Ibrahim, J., Monte Carlo methods in bayesian computation (2000), Springer-Verlag New York; Chowell, G., Castillo-Chavez, C., Fenimore, P., Kribs-Zaleta, C., Model parameters and outbreak control for SARS (2004) Emerging Infectious Diseases, 10, pp. 1258-1263; Cyranoski, D., When will the coronavirus outbreak peak?

We developed an institutional algorithm to protect operating room team members during the COVID-19 pandemic and rationally conserve personal protective equipment (PPE). Study Design: An interventional platform (operating room, interventional suite, and endoscopy) PPE taskforce was convened by the hospital and medical school leadership and tasked with developing a common algorithm for PPE use, to be used throughout the interventional platform. In conjunction with our infectious disease experts, we developed our guidelines based on potential patterns of spread, risk of exposure, and conservation of PPE. Results: A decision tree algorithm describing our institutional guidelines for precautions for operating room team members was created. This algorithm is based on urgency of operation, anticipated viral burden at the surgical site, opportunity for a procedure to aerosolize virus, and likelihood a patient could be infected based on symptoms and testing. Conclusions: Despite COVID-19 being a new threat, we have shown that by developing an easy-to-follow decision tree algorithm for the interventional platform teams, we can ensure optimal health care worker safety. © 2020 American College of Surgeons",,,,,,,,,,,,"Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 497-506; Holshue, M.L., DeBolt, C., Lindquist, S., First case of 2019 novel coronavirus in the United States (2020) N Engl J Med, 382, pp. 929-936; CDC's recommendations for 30 day mitigation strategies for Santa Clara County, California, based on current situation with COVID-19 transmission and affected health care facilities (2020) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, , https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/Santa-Clara_Community_Mitigation.pdf, Available at: (Accessed 28 March 2020); Order of the Health Officer of the County of Santa Clara.

Arancio, Lucca, 55100, Italy","In December 2019, an atypical pneumonia invaded the city of Wuhan, China, and the causative agent of this disease turned out to be a new coronavirus. In January 2020, the World Health Organization named the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV and subsequently it is referred to as SARS-CoV2 and the related disease as CoViD-19 (Lai et al., 2020). Very quickly, the epidemic led to a pandemic and it is now a worldwide emergency requiring the creation of new antiviral therapies and a related vaccine. The purpose of this article is to review and investigate further the molecular mechanism by which the SARS-CoV2 virus infection proceeds via the formation of a hetero-trimer between its protein S, the ACE2 receptor and the B0AT1 protein, which is the “entry receptor” for the infection process involving membrane fusion (Li et al., 2003). A reverse engineering process uses the formalism of the Hill function to represent the functions related to the dynamics of the biochemical interactions of the viral infection process. Then, using a logical evaluation of viral density that measures the rate at which the cells are hijacked by the virus (and they provide a place for the virus to replicate) and considering the “time delay” given by the interaction between cell and virus, the expected duration of the incubation period is predicted. The conclusion is that the density of the virus varies from the “exposure time” to the “interaction time” (virus-cells). This model can be used both to evaluate the infectious condition and to analyze the incubation period. Background: The ongoing threat of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2 pandemic is alarming and strategies for combating infection are highly desired. This RNA virus belongs to the β-coronavirus genus and is similar in some features to SARS-CoV. Currently, no vaccine or approved medical treatment is available. The complex dynamics of the rapid spread of this virus can be demonstrated with the aid of a computational framework. Methods: A mathematical model based on the principles of cell-virus interaction is developed in this manuscript. The amino acid sequence of S proein and its interaction with the ACE-2 protein is mimicked with the aid of Hill function. The mathematical model with delay is solved with the aid of numerical solvers and the parametric values are obtained with the help of MCMC algorithm. Results: A delay differential equation model is developed to demonstrate the dynamics of target cells, infected cells and the SARS-CoV2. The important parameters and coefficients are demonstrated with the aid of numerical computations. The resulting thresholds and forecasting may prove to be useful tools for future experimental studies and control strategies. Conclusions: From the analysis, I is concluded that control strategy via delay is a promising technique and the role of Hill function formalism in control strategies can be better interpreted in an inexpensive manner with the aid of a theoretical framework. © 2020","Dynamical analysis; Kinetic modelling; MCMC analysis; Monoclonal antibody; Numerical simulations; SARS-CoV2",,,,,,,,,,,"Assiri, A., McGeer, A., Perl, T.M., Price, C.S., Al Rabeeah, A.A., Cummings, D.A., Alabdullatif, Z.N., Makhdoom, H., Hospital outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (2013) N.

In August 2014, our team developed and implemented an algorithm to triage suspected cases of Ebola virus disease in a midwestern United States emergency department and outpatient clinics based on patient travel history and symptoms. Here, we present the lessons learned and modifications to update the tool. Methods: Two strategies were developed and utilized to properly identify, isolate, and inform on patients with suspected highly hazardous communicable diseases: 1) a robust electronic symptom and travel screen with decision support tools in the electronic medical record, and 2) the availability of workflow protocols for Ebola virus disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) once a person under investigation is identified. After action reports provided opportunities to modify the algorithm and improve the identification and isolation processes. Results: Since our screening and travel electronic medical record inception 5 years ago, modifications changed iteratively to further enhance the screening process. Since 2018, staff have identified 5 patients at risk for MERS; in all cases, identification occurred during the check-in process. Exposure investigations in the emergency department decreased significantly after algorithm implementation in January 2019, from 30 in 2018 to 0 in 2019. Discussion: Although highly hazardous communicable diseases like Ebola virus disease and MERS are of concern due to their mortality rates and limited treatment options, these same concepts may be applied to the early identification and isolation of patients suspected of having more common communicable diseases like measles and influenza, emphasizing the importance of protocol-based screening in the healthcare environment. © 2020 Emergency Nurses Association","Communicable disease control/methods; Disease outbreaks/prevention and control; Ebola; Emergency service,hospital; Patient isolation",,,,,,,,,,,"Ebola virus disease https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-virus-disease, Available at: Updated 2019.

Unfortunately, some patients who may be or presumptively or confirmed as infected with COVID-2019 may also require emergent surgical procedures. As such, given the high-risk for exposure of many healthcare workers involved the complex requirements for appropriate isolation must be adhered to. Case presentation: We present our experience with a 77-year-old who required emergency cardiac surgery for a presumed acute aortic syndrome in the setting of a presumed, and eventually confirmed, COVID-2019 infection. We outline the necessary steps to maintain strict isolation precautions to limit potential exposure to the surgical Team. Conclusions: We hereby provide our algorithm for emergent surgical procedures in critically-ill patients with presumptive or confirmed infection with COVID-2019. The insights from this case report can potentially be templated to other facilities in order to uphold high standards of infection prevention and patient safety in surgery during the current COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 The Author(s).","COVID-2019; Emergency surgery; Infection control; SARS-CoV-2",,,,,,,,,,,"Dong, E., Du, H., Gardner, L., An interactive web-based dashboard to track COVID-19 in real time (2020) Lancet Infect Dis., , https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30120-1, Epub ahead of print; Wu, Z., McGoogan, J.M., Characteristics of and important lessons from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: Summary of a report of 72 314 cases from the Chinese center for disease control and prevention (2020) JAMA, , https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.2648, Epub ahead of print; Moriarty, L.F., Public health responses to COVID-19 outbreaks on cruise ships-worldwide, February-March 2020 (2020) MMWR, 69 (12), pp. 347-352; Chen, X., Shang, Y., Yao, S., Liu, R., Liu, H., Perioperative care provider's considerations in managing patients with the COVID-19 infections (2020) Transl Perioper Pain Med., 7, pp. 216-224; (2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/controlrecommendations.html, Accessed on 04/03; Stahel, P.F., How to risk-stratify elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic?

Comparative homology modelling may have the potential to close this gap by predicting protein structure in target sequences using existing experimentally solved structures as templates. This paper presents the first use of force-directed graphs for the visualization of sequence space in two dimensions, and applies them to the choice of suitable RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) target-template pairs within human-infective RNA virus genera. Measures of centrality in protein sequence space for each genus were also derived and used to identify centroid nearest-neighbour sequences (CNNs) potentially useful for production of homology models most representative of their genera. Homology modelling was then carried out for target-template pairs in different species, different genera and different families, and model quality assessed using several metrics. Reconstructed ancestral RdRP sequences for individual genera were also used as templates for the production of ancestral RdRP homology models. High quality ancestral RdRP models were consistently produced, as were good quality models for target-template pairs in the same genus. Homology modelling between genera in the same family produced mixed results and inter-family modelling was unreliable. We present a protocol for the production of optimal RdRP homology models for use in further experiments, e.g. docking to discover novel anti-viral compounds.

However, genomic data can be poorly informative of transmission events if mutations accumulate too slowly to resolve individual transmission pairs or if there exist multiple pathogens lineages within-host, and there has been little focus on incorporating other types of outbreak data. We present here a methodology that uses contact data for the inference of transmission trees in a statistically rigorous manner, alongside genomic data and temporal data. Contact data is frequently collected in outbreaks of pathogens spread by close contact, including Ebola virus (EBOV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), and routinely used to reconstruct transmission chains. As an improvement over previous, ad-hoc approaches, we developed a probabilistic model that relates a set of contact data to an underlying transmission tree and integrated this in the outbreaker2 inference framework. By analyzing simulated outbreaks under various contact tracing scenarios, we demonstrate that contact data significantly improves our ability to reconstruct transmission trees, even under realistic limitations on the coverage of the contact tracing effort and the amount of non-infectious mixing between cases. Indeed, contact data is equally or more informative than fully sampled whole genome sequence data in certain scenarios. We then use our method to analyze the early stages of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore and describe the range of transmission scenarios consistent with contact data and genetic sequence in a probabilistic manner for the first time. This simple yet flexible model can easily be incorporated into existing tools for outbreak reconstruction and should permit a better integration of genomic and epidemiological data for inferring transmission chains. © 2019 Campbell et al.",,"algorithm; Article; bacterial transmission; Bayes theorem; Ebolavirus; epidemic; gene mutation; genetic database; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; SARS coronavirus; simulation; Singapore; symptom; virus transmission; whole genome sequencing; biological model; biology; communicable disease; contact examination; genetics; human; procedures; severe acute respiratory syndrome; software; statistics and numerical data; transmission; virology; virus genome; disease course; disease transmission; gene sequence; host pathogen interaction; infectious agent; microbial genome; probability; statistical model; symptom; Algorithms; Bayes Theorem; Communicable Diseases; Computational Biology; Contact Tracing; Disease Outbreaks; Genome, Viral; Humans; Models, Biological; SARS Virus; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Singapore; Software",,,,,,,,,,"Faye, O., Boelle, P.-Y., Heleze, E., Faye, O., Loucoubar, C., N‘Faly, M., Chains of transmission and control of Ebola virus disease in Conakry, Guinea, in 2014: An observational study (2015) Lancet Infect Dis, 15, pp. 320-326. , https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(14)71075-8; Lloyd-Smith, J.O., Schreiber, S.J., Kopp, P.E., Getz, W.M., Superspreading and the effect of individual variation on disease emergence.

MERS-CoV causes disease in humans with thirty-five percent fatality, and has evolved proteins that counteract human antiviral responses. Since bats experimentally infected with MERS-CoV do not develop signs of disease, we tested the hypothesis that MERS-CoV would replicate less efficiently in bat cells than in human cells because of its inability to subvert antiviral responses in bat cells. We infected human and bat (Eptesicus fuscus) cells with MERS-CoV and observed that the virus grew to higher titers in human cells. MERS-CoV also effectively suppressed the antiviral interferon beta (IFNβ) response in human cells, unlike in bat cells. To determine if IRF3, a critical mediator of the interferon response, also regulated the response in bats, we examined the response of IRF3 to poly(I:C), a synthetic analogue of viral double-stranded RNA. We observed that bat IRF3 responded to poly(I:C) by nuclear translocation and post-translational modifications, hallmarks of IRF3 activation. Suppression of IRF3 by small-interfering RNA (siRNA) demonstrated that IRF3 was critical for poly(I:C) and MERS-CoV induced induction of IFNβin bat cells. Our study demonstrates that innate antiviral signaling in E. fuscus bat cells is resistant to MERS-CoV-mediated subversion. © 2019 by the authors.

The intermediate hosts of most of the human coronaviruses are known, but not for HCoV-NL63. This study aims to assess the possible role of some major domestic livestock species as intermediate hosts of HCoV-NL63. We developed a testing algorithm for high throughput screening of livestock sera with ELISA and confirmation with recombinant immunofluorescence assay testing for antibodies against HCoV-NL63 in livestock. Optimization of the ELISA showed a capability of the assay to significantly distinguish HCoV-NL63 from HCoV-229E (U = 27.50, p < 0.001) and HCoV-OC43 (U = 55.50, p < 0.001) in coronavirus-characterized sera. Evaluation of the assay with collected human samples showed no significant difference in mean optical density values of immunofluorescence-classified HCoV-NL63-positive and HCoV-NL63-negative samples (F (1, 215) = 0.437, p = 0.509). All the top 5% (n = 8) most reactive human samples tested by ELISA were HCoV-NL63 positive by immunofluorescence testing. In comparison, only a proportion (84%, n = 42) of the top 25% were positive by immunofluorescence testing, indicating an increased probability of the highly ELISA reactive samples testing positive by the immunofluorescence assay. None of the top 5% most ELISA reactive livestock samples were positive for HCoV-NL63-related viruses by immunofluorescence confirmation. Ghanaian domestic livestock are not likely intermediate hosts of HCoV-NL63-related coronaviruses. © 2019 by the authors.

Since then, sporadic outbreaks with primary transmission through dromedary camels to humans and outbreaks in healthcare settings have shown that MERS-CoV continues to pose a threat to human health. Several serologic assays for MERS-CoV have been developed globally. We describe a collaborative study to investigate the comparability of serologic assays for MERS-CoV and assess any benefit associated with the introduction of a standard reference reagent for MERS-CoV serology. Our study findings indicate that, when possible, laboratories should use a testing algorithm including >2 tests to ensure correct diagnosis of MERS-CoV. We also demonstrate that the use of a reference reagent greatly improves the agreement between assays, enabling more consistent and therefore more meaningful comparisons between results. © 2019 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

In multiple alignments, there are 3 mutation network analyses, namely topological network system, mutation region network and network system of mutation mode. In general, the three analyses show stable and unstable regions that map mutation regions. This area of mutation is described further in a phylogenetic tree which simultaneously illustrates the path of the spread of an epidemic, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic. The process of spreading the SARS viruses, in this case, is described as the process of phylogenetic tree formation, and as a novelty of this research, multiple alignments in the process are analyzed in detail and then optimized with genetic algorithms. Methods: The data used to form the phylogenetic tree for the spread of the SARS epidemic are 14 DNA sequences which are then optimized by using genetic algorithms. The phylogenetic tree is constructed by using the neighbor-joining algorithm with a distance matrix that the intended distance is the genetic distance obtained from sequence alignment by using the Needleman Wunsch Algorithm. Results & Conclusion: The results of the analysis obtained 3649 stable areas and 19 unstable areas. The results of phylogenetic tree from the network system analysis indicated that the spread of the SARS epidemic extended from Guangzhou 16/12/02 to Zhongshan 27/12/02, then spread simultaneously to Guangzhou 18/02/03 and Guangzhou hospital. After that, the virus reached Metropole, Zhongshan, Hongkong, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong kong, and Hanoi which then continued to Guangzhou 01/01/03 and Toronto at once. The results of the mutation region network system demonstrate decomposition of orthogonal mutations in the 1st order arc. © 2019 Amiroch et al.","Genetic algorithm; Multiple sequence alignment; Needleman wunsch algorithm; Optimization; Phylogenetic Tree; SARS epidemic","Article; chromosome; DNA sequence; epidemic; gene locus; gene mutation; genetic algorithm; genetic conservation; genetic distance; human; mathematical model; network learning; nonhuman; phylogeny; population size; priority journal; SARS coronavirus; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; severe acute respiratory syndrome; virus transmission",,,,,"Kementerian Riset Teknologi Dan Pendidikan Tinggi Republik Indonesia

It is known as a coronavirus and referred as a common form of virus that naturally causes upper-respiratory tract illnesses and the symptoms are hard to identify. It is important to recognize the patient and providing them with suitable action with constant intensive care. Healthcare amenities is constructed on fog and big-data based system and it is integrated with cyber-physical system. The role of Cyber physical system in health care domain is to fetch deep insights about the nature of disease and carry the monitoring process with early detection of infected users. The objective is to identify occurrence of SARS at initial stage. In proposed system, resemblance factor is evaluated from the extracted keywords. In order to identify the difference between SARS affected and others, the proposed scheme fetches the inputs from user's displayed in the form of text. It is passed to deep recurrent neural network (RNN) model. It extracts useful information from the raw information given by the user. The J48graft algorithm is used to carry the classification based on the type of infection and symptoms of each user. The data is stored in the bigdata layer (mongoDB) and it detects the infected area by using the geospatial feature in mongo dB. The methodology is framed in the proposed model to prevent the spread of disease to other users. In case of any abnormality the generation of alert process is done instantaneously and directed on user's mobile from fog layer. The final experimental outcome reveals information about the performance of proposed system in terms of Success rate, failure rate, latency and accuracy %. It shows that the proposed algorithm gives high level of accuracy when it is compared with other primitive methods. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

The prioritization process has 3 components: a Delphi process to narrow down a list of potential priority diseases, a multicriteria decision analysis to rank the short list of diseases, and a final Delphi round to arrive at a final list of 10 diseases. A group of international experts applied this process in January 2017, resulting in a list of 10 priority diseases. The robustness of the list was tested by performing a sensitivity analysis.

Box 999, MSIN: K8-78, Richland, WA  99352, United States","Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based proteomics studies of large sample cohorts can easily require from months to years to complete. Acquiring consistent, high-quality data in such large-scale studies is challenging because of normal variations in instrumentation performance over time, as well as artifacts introduced by the samples themselves, such as those because of collection, storage and processing. Existing quality control methods for proteomics data primarily focus on post-hoc analysis to remove low-quality data that would degrade downstream statistics; they are not designed to evaluate the data in near real-time, which would allow for interventions as soon as deviations in data quality are detected. In addition to flagging analyses that demonstrate outlier behavior, evaluating how the data structure changes over time can aide in understanding typical instrument performance or identify issues such as a degradation in data quality because of the need for instrument cleaning and/or re-calibration. To address this gap for proteomics, we developed Quality Control Analysis in Real-Time (QC-ART), a tool for evaluating data as they are acquired to dynamically flag potential issues with instrument performance or sample quality. QC-ART has similar accuracy as standard post-hoc analysis methods with the additional benefit of real-time analysis. We demonstrate the utility and performance of QC-ART in identifying deviations in data quality because of both instrument and sample issues in near real-time for LC-MS-based plasma proteomics analyses of a sample subset of The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young cohort. We also present a case where QC-ART facilitated the identification of oxidative modifications, which are often underappreciated in proteomic experiments. © 2018 Stanfill et al.",,"cysteine; methionine; tryptophan; tyrosine; peptide; accuracy; amino acid sequence; Article; benchmarking; Calu-3 cell line; cohort analysis; comparative study; data analysis; human; human cell; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; longitudinal study; oxidation; pancreas islet beta cell; plasma; post hoc analysis; priority journal; prospective study; protein analysis; protein database; proteomics; quality control; Quality Control Analysis in Real Time; receiver operating characteristic; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Shewanella oneidensis; algorithm; computer interface; computer system; isotope labeling; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; procedures; proteomics; standards; tandem mass spectrometry; Algorithms; Cohort Studies; Computer Systems; Databases, Protein; Humans; Isotope Labeling; Oxidation-Reduction; Peptides; Proteomics; Quality Control; ROC Curve; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; User-Computer Interface",,"cysteine, 4371-52-2, 52-89-1, 52-90-4; methionine, 59-51-8, 63-68-3, 7005-18-7; tryptophan, 6912-86-3, 73-22-3; tyrosine, 16870-43-2, 55520-40-6, 60-18-4; Peptides",,,"University of Colorado, CU: UL1 TR001082

In routine care, pediatricians often resort to clinical diagnoses, even in the absence of robust evidence-based criteria. We used a dual approach to identify clinical characteristics that may help to differentiate infections with common pathogens including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, bocavirus-1, coronaviruses, or parainfluenza virus: (a) systematic review and meta-analysis of 47 clinical studies published in Medline (June 1996 to March 2017, PROSPERO registration number: CRD42017059557) comprising 49 858 individuals and (b) data-driven analysis of an inception cohort of 6073 children with ILI (aged 0-18 years, 56% male, December 2009 to March 2015) examined at the point of care in addition to blinded PCR testing. We determined pooled odds ratios for the literature analysis and compared these to odds ratios based on the clinical cohort dataset. This combined analysis suggested significant associations between influenza and fever or headache, as well as between respiratory syncytial virus infection and cough, dyspnea, and wheezing. Similarly, literature and cohort data agreed on significant associations between HMPV infection and cough, as well as adenovirus infection and fever. Importantly, none of the abovementioned features were unique to any particular pathogen but were also observed in association with other respiratory viruses. In summary, our “real-world” dataset confirmed published literature trends, but no individual feature allows any particular type of viral infection to be ruled in or ruled out. For the time being, laboratory confirmation remains essential. More research is needed to develop scientifically validated decision models to inform best practice guidelines and targeted diagnostic algorithms. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","children; clinical symptoms; respiratory viruses","Bocaparvovirus; clinical feature; Coronavirinae; coughing; dyspnea; fever; headache; human; Human respiratory syncytial virus; influenza; Influenza virus; Medline; Metapneumovirus; nonhuman; Paramyxovirinae; respiratory syncytial virus infection; Review; Rhinovirus; systematic review; viral respiratory tract infection; wheezing; adolescent; age; child; clinical study; cohort analysis; differential diagnosis; infant; meta analysis; newborn; odds ratio; preschool child; respiratory tract infection; symptom assessment; virology; virus infection; Adolescent; Age Factors; Child; Child, Preschool; Clinical Studies as Topic; Cohort Studies; Diagnosis, Differential; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Odds Ratio; Respiratory Tract Infections; Symptom Assessment; Virus Diseases",,,,,"201508080019","Robert Koch Institute supported the laboratory work.

Methods: The study included 680 South African patients randomly selected in age-defined categories from hospitalised patients enrolled through SARI surveillance during 2012 to 2013. A multiplex reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction assay was used to detect hBoV; hCoV-OC43, hCoV-229E, hCoV-NL63, and hCoV-HKU1; and Washington University hPyV (hPyV-WU) and Karolinska Insitute hPyV (hPyV-KI), in respiratory tract specimens collected from patients with SARI. All respiratory specimens from patients enrolled through SARI surveillance were also routinely tested by multiplex reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction for adenovirus; enterovirus; human metapneumovirus; parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3; respiratory syncytial virus; rhinovirus; influenza A, and influenza B. Results: Human bocavirus, hCoV-229E, and hPyV-WU were detected in 3.7% (25/680), 4.1% (28/680), and 4.1% (28/680) of respiratory specimens, respectively. All other viruses were detected in <2% of specimens. Rhinovirus was the most common coinfecting virus (21.4%-60.7%), followed by adenovirus (21.4%-39.3%), and respiratory syncytial virus (10.7%-24.0%). Testing for the additional viruses (hBoV, hCoV, and hPyV) decreased the number of specimens that initially tested negative by 2.9% (20/680). Conclusion: Inclusion of laboratory tests for hBoV, hCoV-229E, and hPyV-WU in differential testing algorithms for surveillance and diagnostics for suspected cases of respiratory illness of unknown cause may improve our understanding of the etiology of SARI, especially in a country like South Africa with a high number of immune compromised persons. © 2018 The Authors.

This not only aids to understand the disease mechanism, but also helps to identify unexpected therapeutic activity or adverse side effects of drugs. Hence, drug-target interaction prediction becomes an essential tool in the field of drug repurposing. The availability of heterogeneous biological data on known drug-target interactions enabled many researchers to develop various computational methods to decipher unknown drug-target interactions. This review provides an overview on these computational methods for predicting drug-target interactions along with available webservers and databases for drug-target interactions. Further, the applicability of drug-target interactions in various diseases for identifying lead compounds has been outlined. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.","Drug design; Drug repurposing; Drug-target interaction; Feature based method; Machine learning; Polypharmacology; Semi-supervised method; Similarity based method; Supervised method","3 oxoacyl acyl carrier protein reductase; acetylcholinesterase; aldehyde reductase; alpha glucosidase; amyloid beta protein; B Raf kinase; DNA topoisomerase; ephrin receptor B4; glucokinase; Human immunodeficiency virus proteinase; integrase; phospholipase A2; prostaglandin synthase; protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B; proteinase; RNA directed RNA polymerase; secretase; sortase; urease; protein binding; amino acid sequence; computer prediction; correspondence analysis; drug design; drug repositioning; drug structure; drug targeting; gene expression; isothermal titration calorimetry; kernel method; machine learning; mathematical computing; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; protein interaction; protein protein interaction; Review; SARS coronavirus; spectrofluorometry; structure activity relation; X ray crystallography; algorithm; biology; chemical database; chemical structure; computer simulation; drug development; human; procedures; protein database; Algorithms; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Databases, Chemical; Databases, Protein; Drug Discovery; Humans; Molecular Structure; Protein Binding; Structure-Activity Relationship",,"3 oxoacyl acyl carrier protein reductase, 37250-34-3; acetylcholinesterase, 9000-81-1; aldehyde reductase, 58591-34-7, 9023-11-4, 9028-31-3; alpha glucosidase, 9001-42-7; amyloid beta protein, 109770-29-8; DNA topoisomerase, 80449-01-0; glucokinase, 37237-53-9, 9001-36-9; Human immunodeficiency virus proteinase, 144114-21-6; phospholipase A2, 9001-84-7; prostaglandin synthase, 39391-18-9, 59763-19-8, 9055-65-6; proteinase, 9001-92-7; RNA directed RNA polymerase, 9026-28-2; urease, 9002-13-5",,,"Department of Science and Technology, Government of Kerala: SR/WOS/LS62/2013","SA thanks Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India, New Delhi, for the research grant (Grant No: SR/WOS/LS62/2013) under Women Scientist Scheme-A.

However, the virome of PEDV infected pigs and its effect on disease severity remains unknown. The advancements of sequencing technology have made it possible to characterize the entire microbiome of different body sites for any host. Methods: The objective of this study was to characterize the RNA virome in PEDV-positive pigs using the hypothesis-free metagenomics approach based on next-generation sequencing. Specifically, 217 PEDV-positive swine fecal swab samples collected from diarrheic piglets over 17 US states during 2015-2016 were analyzed. Results: A Kraken algorithm-based bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of up to 9 different RNA genera besides PEDV (Alphacoronavirus genus), including Mamastrovirus (52%, 113/217), Enterovirus (39%, 85/217), Sapelovirus (31%, 67/217), Posavirus (30%, 66/217), Kobuvirus (23%, 49/217), Sapovirus (13%, 28/217), Teschovirus (10%, 22/217), Pasivirus (9%, 20/217), and Deltacoronavirus (3%, 6/217). There were 58 out of 217 piglets (27%) have PEDV infection alone whereas the remaining 159 (73%) shed 2 up to 9 different viruses. Conclusion: These findings demonstrated that PEDV infected diarrheic pigs had an extensive RNA viral flora consisting of four different families: Astroviridae, Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae, and Coronaviridae. © 2018 The Author(s).","Coinfection; Metagenomic analysis; PEDV; RNA virome","algorithm; Alphacoronavirus; Article; Astroviridae; bioinformatics; Caliciviridae; controlled study; Coronaviridae; Deltacoronavirus; Enterovirus; feces culture; Kobuvirus; Mamastrovirus; metagenomics; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; Pasivirus; Picornaviridae; piglet; porcine epidemic diarrhea; Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; Posavirus; RNA virus; Sapelovirus; Sapovirus; Teschovirus; United States; agricultural land; amino acid sequence; animal; biology; classification; Coronavirus infection; DNA sequence; feces; genetics; high throughput sequencing; isolation and purification; metagenomics; mixed infection; phylogeny; pig; Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; procedures; sequence alignment; sequence homology; swine disease; veterinary medicine; virology; virus RNA; Algorithms; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Astroviridae; Caliciviridae; Coinfection; Computational Biology; Coronaviridae; Coronavirus Infections; Farms; Feces; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Metagenomics; Phylogeny; Picornaviridae; Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; RNA, Viral; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Swine; Swine Diseases; United States",,"RNA, Viral",,,"U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA","This study was supported by USDA NAHLN Program Office.",,,,"Zhang, B., Tang, C., Yue, H., Ren, Y., Song, Z., Viral metagenomics analysis demonstrates the diversity of viral flora in piglet diarrhoeic faeces in China (2014) J Gen Virol, 95, pp. 1603-1611. , 24718833; Chen, Q., Li, G., Stasko, J., Thomas, J.T., Stensland, W.R., Pillatzki, A.E., Gauger, P.C., Yoon, K.J., Isolation and characterization of porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses associated with the 2013 disease outbreak among swine in the United States (2014) J Clin Microbiol, 52 (1), pp. 234-243. , 24197882 3911415; Madson, D.M., Magstadt, D.R., Arruda, P.H., Hoang, H., Sun, D., Bower, L.P., Bhandari, M., Pillatzki, A.E., Pathogenesis of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus isolate (US/Iowa/18984/2013) in 3-week-old weaned pigs (2014) Vet Microbiol, 174 (1-2), pp. 60-68. , 25278366; Stevenson, G.W., Hoang, H., Schwartz, K.J., Burrough, E.R., Sun, D., Madson, D., Cooper, V.L., Schmitt, B.J., Emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in the United States: Clinical signs, lesions, and viral genomic sequences (2013) J Vet Diagn Investig, 25 (5), pp. 649-654; Chen, Q., Gauger, P.C., Stafne, M.R., Thomas, J.T., Madson, D.M., Huang, H., Zheng, Y., Zhang, J., Pathogenesis comparison between the United States porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus prototype and S-INDEL-variant strains in conventional neonatal piglets (2016) J Gen Virol, 97 (5), pp. 1107-1121. , 26841768; Lin, C.M., Gao, X., Oka, T., Vlasova, A.N., Esseili, M.A., Wang, Q., Saif, L.J., Antigenic relationships among porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus strains (2015) J Virol, 89 (6), pp. 3332-3342. , 25589635 4337547; Marthaler, D., Raymond, L., Jiang, Y., Collins, J., Rossow, K., Rovira, A., Rapid detection, complete genome sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis of porcine deltacoronavirus (2014) Emerg Infect Dis, 20 (8), pp. 1347-1350. , 25075556 4111195; Wang, L., Byrum, B., Zhang, Y., Detection and genetic characterization of deltacoronavirus in pigs, Ohio, USA, 2014 (2014) Emerg Infect Dis, 20 (7), pp. 1227-1230. , 24964136 4073853; MiSeq System Guide, , https://support.illumina.com/downloads/miseq_system_user_guide_15027617.html; Bolger, A.M., Lohse, M., Usadel, B., Trimmomatic: A flexible trimmer for Illumina sequence data (2014) Bioinformatics, 30 (15), pp. 2114-2120. , 24695404 4103590; Wood, D.E., Salzberg, S.L., Kraken: Ultrafast metagenomic sequence classification using exact alignments (2014) Genome Biol, 15 (3), p.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a risk prediction model for the screening of suspected cases of MERS-CoV infection in patients who have developed pneumonia. Methods: A two-center, retrospective case–control study was performed. A total of 360 patients with confirmed pneumonia who were evaluated for MERS-CoV infection by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) between September 1, 2012 and June 1, 2016 at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh and King Fahad General Hospital in Jeddah, were included. According to the rRT-PCR results, 135 patients were positive for MERS-CoV and 225 were negative. Demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, and radiological and laboratory findings were collected for each subject. Results: A risk prediction model to identify pneumonia patients at increased risk of MERS-CoV was developed. The model included male sex, contact with a sick patient or camel, diabetes, severe illness, low white blood cell (WBC) count, low alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and high aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The model performed well in predicting MERS-CoV infection (area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC) 0.8162), on internal validation (AUC 0.8037), and on a goodness-of-fit test (p = 0.592). The risk prediction model, which produced an optimal probability cut-off of 0.33, had a sensitivity of 0.716 and specificity of 0.783. Conclusions: This study provides a simple, practical, and valid algorithm to identify pneumonia patients at increased risk of MERS-CoV infection. This risk prediction model could be useful for the early identification of patients at the highest risk of MERS-CoV infection. Further validation of the prediction model on a large prospective cohort of representative patients with pneumonia is necessary. © 2018 The Author(s)","Early diagnosis; MERS-CoV case definitions; Pneumonia; Saudi Arabia","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; alanine aminotransferase; adolescent; adult; aged; alanine aminotransferase level; algorithm; Article; aspartate aminotransferase level; camel; case control study; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; disease severity; female; fever; gastrointestinal symptom; high risk patient; human; leukocyte count; major clinical study; male; Middle East respiratory syndrome; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; nonhuman; pneumonia; real time polymerase chain reaction; respiratory tract disease; retrospective study; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Saudi Arabia; sensitivity and specificity; animal; clinical trial; complication; Coronavirus infection; early diagnosis; genetics; immunology; isolation and purification; metabolism; middle aged; multicenter study; pneumonia; predictive value; program development; risk; Saudi Arabia; validation study; very elderly; virology; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alanine Transaminase; Animals; Camelus; Case-Control Studies; Coronavirus Infections; Early Diagnosis; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Pneumonia; Predictive Value of Tests; Program Development; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Retrospective Studies; Risk; Saudi Arabia; Young Adult",,"alanine aminotransferase, 9000-86-6, 9014-30-6; aspartate aminotransferase, 9000-97-9; Alanine Transaminase",,,,,,,,"Ahmed, A.E., McClish, D.K., Schubert, C.M., Accuracy and cost comparison in medical testing using sequential testing strategies (2011) Stat Med, pp. 3416-3430; Ahmed, A.E., Schubert, C.M., McClish, D.K., Reducing cost in sequential testing: a limit of indifference approach (2013) Stat Med, pp. 2715-2727; Ahmed, A.E., McClish, D.K., Schubert, C.M., Believe the extreme (BE) strategy at the optimal point: what strategy will it become?

An example of data that still rapidly growing is the dataset of medical information from patients suffering from Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV); MERS-CoV is a viral respiratory disease spreading worldwide. Since the need for an accurate diagnosis system that predicts MERS-CoV infections has increased, exploiting the classifier model performance of different classification types can greatly help to improve the prediction accuracy of MERS-CoV infection. In this paper, we examine classifier model performance for three classification types: 1) binary; 2) multi-class; and 3) multi-label, on a text-based MERS-CoV dataset using a cross-validation model to measure the accuracy of ¿-nearest neighbor, decision tree, and naïve Bayes algorithms. Our empirical study concluded that the decision tree classifier performed best for binary classification, with an accuracy of 90%. In contrast, for multi-class classification, the ¿-nearest neighbor algorithm had a comparatively good accuracy measurement, 51.60%, but did not reach a satisfactory accuracy level. For multi-label classification, the naïve Bayes classifier was the most accurate, at 77%. This work is conducted as a part of a larger project dedicated to producing a MERS-CoV prediction system. © 2017 IEEE.","accuracy measurement; classification; classifier model; cross-validation model; Data mining; medical data mining; MERS-CoV; text-based dataset","Binary trees; Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Decision trees; Intelligent systems; Medical computing; Text processing; Accuracy measurements; Classifier models; Cross validation; Medical data mining; MERS-CoV; text-based dataset; Data mining",,,,,,,,,,"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), , http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/, [Online] [Accessed 01-Jan-2017]; Coronavirus Website-Ministry of Health, , http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/, [Online] [Accessed 01-Jan-2017]; RapidMiner Studio-Rapid Miner Documentation, , http://docs.rapidminer.com/studio/, [Online] [Accessed 01-Jan-2017]; Han, J., Kamber, M., Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques, , 2nd ed; Ilayaraja, M., Meyyappan, T., Mining medical data to identify frequent diseases using a priori algorithm (2013) 2013 Int Conf Pattern Recognition, Informatics and Mobile Eng, pp. 194-199; Jyoti, S., Ujma, A., Dipesh, S., Sunita, S., Predictive data mining for medical diagnosis: An overview of heart disease prediction (2011) Int J Comput Appl, 17 (8), pp. 43-48; Antonie, M., Zaane, O.R., Coman, A., Application of data mining techniques for medical image classification (2002) ResearchGate; Subbalakshmi, G., Ramesh, K., Rao, M.C., Decision support in heart disease prediction system using naive Bayes (2012) Indian J Comput Sci Eng IJCSE, 2 (2), pp. 170-176; Jyoti, S., Ujma, A., Dipesh, S., Sunita, S., Predictive data mining for medical diagnosis: An overview of heart disease prediction (2014) Int J Comput Appl, 17 (8), pp. 43-48; Jang, S., Lee, S., Seong-Min, C., Seo, J., Choi, H., Yoon, T., Comparison between SARS CoV and MERS CoV using a priori algorithm, decision tree, SVM (2016) MATEC Web of Conf, p. 49; Sandhu, R., Sood, S.K., Kaur, G., An intelligent system for predicting and preventing MERS-CoV infection outbreak (2015) J Supercomput, pp. 1-24; Estella, F., Delgado-Márquez, B.L., Rojas, P., Valenzuela, O., San Roman, B., Rojas, I., Advanced system for autonomously classify brain MRI in neurodegenerative disease (2012) 2012 Int Conf Multimedia Comput Syst (ICMCS), pp. 250-255; Coronavirus, , https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html, [Online] [Accessed 01-Jan-2017]; MERS Outbreak in South Korea, , http://www.healthmap.org/site/diseasedaily/article/mers-outbreak-southkorea-6715, [Online]; WHO Guidelines for Investigation of Cases of Human Infection with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2013, , http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/MERS_CoV_investigation_guideline_Jul13.pdf, [Online] [Accessed 01-Jan-2017]; Lu, L., Liu, Q., Du, L., Jiang, S., Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV): Challenges in identifying its source and controlling its spread (2013) Microbes and Infection, 15 (8), pp. 625-629; (2001) The Technology Review Ten, , MIT Technology Review January/February; Yoo, I., Alafaireet, P., Marinov, M., Pena-Hernandez, K., Gopidi, R., Chang, J.F., Hua, L., Data mining in healthcare and biomedicine: A survey of the literature (2011) Springer Science + Business Media, LLC; Larose, D.T., (2004) Discovering Knowledge in Data: An Introduction to Data Mining, , Wiley; Hand, D., Mannila, H., Smyth, P., (2001) Principles of Data Mining, , MIT; Tomar, D., Agarwal, S., A survey on data mining approaches for healthcare (2013) Int.

The first MERS case of Korea was reported on 20 May 2015, and since then, the MERS outbreak in Korea has resulted in hundreds of confirmed cases and tens of deaths. Deadly infectious diseases such as MERS have significant direct and indirect social impacts, which include disease-induced mortality and economic losses. Also, a delayed response to the outbreak and underestimating its danger can further aggravate the situation. Hence, an analysis and establishing efficient strategies for preventing the propagation of MERS is a very important and urgent issue. In this paper, we propose a class of nonlinear susceptible-infectious-quarantined (SIQ) models for analyzing and controlling the MERS outbreak in Korea. For the SIQ based ordinary differential equation (ODE) model, we perform the task of parameter estimation, and apply optimal control theory to the controlled SIQ model, with the goal of minimizing the infectious compartment population and the cost of implementing the quarantine and isolation strategies. Simulation results show that the proposed SIQ model can explain the observed data for the confirmed cases and the quarantined cases in the MERS outbreak very well, and the number of the MERS cases can be controlled reasonably well via the optimal control approach. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Coronavirus; Epidemiological model; Optimal control; Parameter estimation","cause of death; disease control; disease spread; economic impact; epidemiology; mortality; parameter estimation; respiratory disease; social impact; virus; Article; control strategy; controlled study; cost control; epidemic; human; infection control; infection prevention; infection sensitivity; Korea; mathematical model; Middle East respiratory syndrome; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; nonlinear system; patient isolation; priority journal; quarantine; simulation; susceptible population; virus isolation; algorithm; computer simulation; Coronavirus infection; economics; epidemic; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; mortality; nonlinear system; procedures; public health; South Korea; statistics and numerical data; survival rate; transmission; Korea; Coronavirus; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Nonlinear Dynamics; Public Health; Quarantine; Republic of Korea; Survival Rate",,,,,"Korea University, KU","This work was supported by a Korea University Grant.",,,,"Bishop, C.M., Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (2006), Springer New York; Buonomo, B., Messina, E., Impact of vaccine arrival on the optimal control of a newly emerging infectious disease: a theoretical study (2012) Math.

Emergence and continuous reporting of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia emphasize the need for surveillance of MERS-CoV in returning pilgrims or travelers from the Middle East and capacity building of health care providers for disease containment. The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control & Research (IEDCR) under the Bangladesh Ministry of Health and Family welfare (MoHFW), is responsible for MERS-CoV screening of pilgrims/ travelers returning from the Middle East with respiratory illness as part of its outbreak investigation and surveillance activities. Methods Bangladeshi travelers/pilgrims who returned from the Middle East and presented with fever and respiratory symptoms were studied over the period from October 2013 to June 2016. Patients with respiratory symptoms that fulfilled the WHO MERS-CoV case algorithm were tested for MERS-CoV and other respiratory tract viruses. Beside surveillance, case recognition training was conducted at multiple levels of health care facilities across the country in support of early detection and containment of the disease. Results Eighty one suspected cases tested by real time PCR resulted in zero detection of MERS-CoV infection. Viral etiology detected in 29.6% of the cases was predominantly influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), and influenza B infection (22%). Peak testing occurred mostly following the annual Hajj season. Conclusions Respiratory tract infections in travelers/pilgrims returning to Bangladesh from the Middle East are mainly due to influenza A and influenza B. Though MERS-CoV was not detected in the 81 patients tested, continuous screening and surveillance are essential for early detection of MERS-CoV infection and other respiratory pathogens to prevent transmissions in hospital settings and within communities. Awareness building among healthcare providers will help identify suspected cases. © 2018 Muraduzzaman et al.

For instance, skew analysis of the nucleotide bias of several viral RNA genomes indicated that it is enriched in the unpaired, single-stranded genome regions, thus creating an even more striking virus-specific signature. The comparison of skew graphs for many virus isolates or families is difficult, time-consuming, and nonquantitative. Here, we present a procedure for a more simple identification of similarities and dissimilarities between nucleotide skew data of coronavirus, flavivirus, picornavirus, and HIV-1 RNA genomes. Window and step sizes were normalized to correct for differences in length of the viral genome. Cumulative skew data are converted into pairwise Euclidean distance matrices, which can be presented as neighbor-joining trees. We present skew value trees for the four virus families and show that closely related viruses are placed in small clusters. Importantly, the skew value trees are similar to the trees constructed by a “classical” model of evolutionary nucleotide substitution. Thus, we conclude that the simple calculation of Euclidean distances between nucleotide skew data allows an easy and quantitative comparison of characteristic sequence signatures of virus genomes. These results indicate that the Euclidean distance analysis of nucleotide skew data forms a nice addition to the virology toolbox.

This study is undertaken to develop an efficient computational approach for timely encoding protein sequences and extracting the hidden information. Methods: Based on two physicochemical properties of amino acids, a protein primary sequence was converted into a three-letter sequence, and then a graph without loops and multiple edges and its geometric line adjacency matrix were obtained. A generalized PseAAC (pseudo amino acid composition) model was thus constructed to characterize a protein sequence numerically. Results: By using the proposed mathematical descriptor of a protein sequence, similarity comparisons among β-globin proteins of 17 species and 72 spike proteins of coronaviruses were made, respectively. The resulting clusters agreed well with the established taxonomic groups. In addition, a generalized PseAAC based SVM (support vector machine) model was developed to identify DNA-binding proteins. Experiment results showed that our method performed better than DNAbinder, DNA-Prot, iDNA-Prot and enDNA-Prot by 3.29-10.44% in terms of ACC, 0.056-0.206 in terms of MCC, and 1.45-15.76% in terms of F1M. When the benchmark dataset was expanded with negative samples, the presented approach outperformed the four previous methods with improvement in the range of 2.49-19.12% in terms of ACC, 0.05-0.32 in terms of MCC, and 3.82-33.85% in terms of F1M. Conclusion: These results suggested that the generalized PseAAC model was very efficient for comparison and analysis of protein sequences, and very competitive in identifying DNA-binding proteins. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.","Adjacency matrix; Generalized PseAAC; Graph; Identification of DNA-binding proteins; Phylogenetic analysis; Protein sequences","amino acid; DNA binding protein; hemoglobin beta chain; viral protein; amino acid; DNA binding protein; amino acid sequence; Article; benchmarking; Coronavirinae; mathematical parameters; nonhuman; phylogeny; physical chemistry; priority journal; protein analysis; support vector machine; algorithm; amino acid sequence; biology; chemistry; computer graphics; information processing; procedures; sequence homology; support vector machine; Algorithms; Amino Acid Sequence; Amino Acids; Computational Biology; Computer Graphics; Datasets as Topic; DNA-Binding Proteins; Phylogeny; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Support Vector Machine",,"amino acid, 65072-01-7; Amino Acids; DNA-Binding Proteins",,,"Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province: 201602005

The control intervention was conducted during the MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea immediately after the confirmation of the index case. This study investigates whether the early risk communication with the general public and mass media is an effective preventive strategy. Methods: The SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model with estimated parameters for the time series data of the daily MERS-CoV incidence in Korea was considered from May to December 2015. For 10,000 stochastic simulations, the SEIR model was computed using the Gillespie algorithm. Depending on the time of control intervention on the 20th, 40th, and 60th days after the identification of the index case, the box plots of MERS-CoV incidences in Korea were computed, and the results were analyzed via ANOVA. Results: The box plots showed that there was a significant difference between the non-intervention and intervention groups (the 20th day, 40th day, and 60th day groups) and seemed to show no significant difference based on the time of intervention. However, the ANOVA revealed that early intervention was a good strategy to control the disease. Conclusion: Appropriate risk communication can secure the confidence of the general public in the public health authorities. © 2017 Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","Basic reproduction number; Infectious disease transmission; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","algorithm; Article; basic reproduction number; incidence; infection control; mass medium; Middle East respiratory syndrome; priority journal; public health message; simulation; South Korea; virus transmission",,,,,"Rural Development Administration, RDA","This study was carried out with the support of the Research Program of Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea (Project No. PJ011563).",,,,"Hsieh, Y.H., 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) nosocomial outbreak in South Korea: insights from modeling (2015) PeerJ, 3. , https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.1505; Kim, Y., Lee, S., Chu, C., The characteristics of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus transmission dynamics in South Korea (2016) Osong Public Health Res Perspect, 7, pp. 49-55. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrp.2016.01.001; Lee, J., Chowell, G., Jung, E., A dynamic compartmental model for the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in the Republic of Korea: A retrospective analysis on control interventions and superspreading events (2016) J Theor Biol, 408, pp. 118-126. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2016.08.009; Mizumoto, K., Saitoh, M., Chowell, G., Estimating the risk of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) death during the course of the outbreak in the Republic of Korea, 2015 (2015) Int J Infect Dis, 39, pp. 7-9. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2015.08.005; Park, H.Y., Lee, E.J., Ryu, Y.W., Epidemiological investigation of MERS-CoV spread in a single hospital in South Korea (2015) Euro Surveill, 20, pp. 1-6. , https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES2015.20.25.21169, May to June 2015; Stone, L., Shulgin, B., Agur, Z., Theoretical examination of the pulse vaccination policy in the SIR epidemic model (2000) Math Comput Model, 31, pp. 207-215. , https://doi.org/10.1016/S0895-7177(00)00040-6; Virlogeux, V., Fang, V.J., Park, M., Comparison of incubation period distribution of human infections with MERS-CoV in South Korea and Saudi Arabia (2016) Sci Rep, 6, p. 35839. , https://doi.org/10.1038/srep35839; Virlogeux, V., Park, M., Wu, J.T., Association between severity of MERS-CoV infection and incubation period (2016) Emerg Infect Dis, 22, pp. 526-528. , https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2203.151437; Xia, Z.Q., Zhang, J., Xue, Y.K., Modeling the transmission of Middle East respirator syndrome corona virus in the Republic of Korea (2015) PLoS One, 10. , https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0144778; Lee, D.H., Masud, M.A., Kim, B.N., Optimal control analysis for the MERS-CoV outbreak: South Korea perspectives (2017) J KSIAM, 21, pp. 143-154; Gillespie, D.T., Exact stochastic simulation of coupled chemical reactions (1977) J Phys Chem, 81, pp. 2340-2361. , https://doi.org/10.1021/j100540a008","Kim, Y.; Department of Mathematics, Kyungpook National UniversitySouth Korea; email: yongkuk@knu.ac.kr",,,"Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",,,,,22109099,,,,"English","Osong Public Health Res.

The algorithm was designed to target antimicrobial therapy in systemically ill calves from on two dairy farms. Retrospective (farm 1: 529 calves; farm 2: 639 calves) and prospective (farm 1: 639 calves; farm 2: 842 calves) cohorts were examined for 12 months before and after implementation of the algorithm. The Mantel–Haenszel test and Kaplan–Meier survival curves were used to assess the cumulative incidence risk (CIR) and time to development of each outcome before and after implementation of the algorithm. The CIR of antimicrobial treatment rates was 80% lower after implementation of the algorithm on both farms (CIR 0.19, 95% confidence interval 0.17–0.21). There was no difference in the CIR of overall mortality, but the CRI for mortality of diarrhoeic calves was lower in the period after implementation of the algorithm on one farm. The faecal microbiota of 15 healthy calves from both farms at each time period were characterised using a sequencing platform targeting the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. On both farms, there were significant differences in community membership and structure (parsimony P < 0.001). Use of the algorithm for treatment of diarrhoeic calves reduced antimicrobial treatment rates without a negative impact on the health of calves. However, the experimental design did not take into account the potential confounding effects of dietary changes between the study periods. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Antimicrobial stewardship; Calf diarrhoea;

In this paper, we analyzed the transmission route of MERS-CoV with a novel molecular approach. We collected the amino acid sequence of MERS-CoV from 15 different regions, which were then analyzed with Neural Network and Support Vector Machine. With the usage of artificial intelligence algorithms, while there was a failure on extracting a rule which can distinguish each virus and figuring out the transmission route, the common features of the sequences were detected. As a result, we could justify the previously studied result on the transmission route.

The cases happened relate to the countries in the Arabian Peninsula (Middle East) and there were 356 deaths have been reported due to the spread of the epidemic MERS. The data used in the case of MERS are the data DNA sequences taken from Genbank, the online database of the United States that stores the results of molecular biological experiments from all over the world (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). In this case, bioinformatics plays an important role of reading sequences of DNA and genetic information by using the main device in the form of software that is supported by the availability of the Internet, while the analysis there in made and proven with mathematical methods. In similar research conducted by molecular biologists and physicians, the process of DNA sequencing is done with software that is already available like BLAST. In order to determine the MERS geographical distribution patterns in the Arabian Peninsula is done with program Clustal W, Bayesian, Phylip, etc. In this study, the writer use the Matlab simulation for all processes starting sequence alignment, counting the number of transitions and transversion substitutions for each sequence and its location up to the process of forming a phylogenetic tree that figures out the pattern of spread of the epidemic MERS. Mathematical analysis performed on a decline in the formula is to find Kimura evolutionary models and the process of forming a phylogenetic tree (the pattern of the epidemic MERS distribution) with neighbor joining algorithm. Finally it was obtained the pattern of geographical spread with 6 groups epidemic of MERS which ultimately turns out that all the MERS viruses that were spread in the Arabian Peninsula everything are almost the same as the virus sequence found in al-Hasa. © 2017 Author(s).",,,,,,,,,,,,"Christianini, N., Hahn, M.W., (2006) Introduction to Computational Genomics A Case Studies Approach, , Cambridge University Press, New York; Cotten, (2014) Spread, Circulation, and Evolution of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, 5 (13). , http://mbio.asm.org, accessed on 12th April 2015 1E01062; Irawan, I., Amiroch, S., Construction of Phylogenetic Tree Using Neighbor Joining Algorithms to Identify the Host and the Spreading of SARS Epidemic (2015) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, 71 (3), pp. 424-429; Isaev, A., (2006) Introduction to Mathematical Methods in Bioinformatics, , Springer; Kimura, M., A Simple Method for Estimating EvolutionaryRates of Base Substitutions Through Comparative Studies of Nucleotide Sequence (1980) Journal of Molecular Evolution, 16, pp. 111-120; Saitou, N., Nei, M., The Neighbor-Joining Method: A New Method for Reconstructing Phylogenetic Trees.

Detection and the study of the molecular pathogenesis of the virus often involve the use of real-time quantitative PCR assays (qPCR). To account for error within the experiments, the levels of target gene transcription are normalized to that of suitable reference genes. Despite publication of the MIQE (Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments) guidelines in 2009, single un-tested reference genes are often used for normalization of qPCR assays in avian research studies. Here, we use the geNorm algorithm to identify suitable reference genes in different avian cell types during infection with apathogenic and pathogenic strains of IBV. We discuss the importance of selecting an appropriate experimental sample subset for geNorm analysis, and show the effect that this selection can have on resultant reference gene selection. The effects of inappropriate normalization on the transcription pattern of a cellular signalling gene, AKT1, and the interferon-inducible, MX1, were studied. We identify the possibility of the misinterpretation of qPCR data when an inappropriate normalization strategy is employed. This is most notable when measuring the transcription of AKT1, where changes are minimal during infection. © 2016 Houghton Trust Ltd.","geNorm; Infectious bronchitis virus; normalization; real-time quantitative PCR; reference gene selection","animal; Avian infectious bronchitis virus; bird disease; chicken; Coronavirus infection; genetics; germfree animal; isolation and purification; kidney; procedures; real time polymerase chain reaction; standard; veterinary medicine; virology; Animals; Chickens; Coronavirus Infections; Infectious bronchitis virus; Kidney; Poultry Diseases; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reference Standards; Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms",,,,,"Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, BBSRC: BB/J016837/1, BB/L003996/1","This work was supported by the BBSRC under [grant number BB/J016837/1]; [grant number BB/L003996/1] and BBSRC Pirbright Institute Fund.",,,,"(2004), Normalization of real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR data: a model-based variance estimation approach to identify genes suited for normalization, applied to bladder and colon cancer data sets.

Furthermore, laboratories also play a role in real-time zoonotic, environmental, and epidemiological investigations to identify the ultimate source of the epidemic, facilitating measures to eventually control the outbreak. Each assay modality has unique pros and cons; therefore, incorporation of a battery of tests using traditional culture-based, molecular and serological diagnostics into diagnostic algorithms is often required. As such, laboratories face challenges in assay development, test evaluation, and subsequent quality assurance. In this review, we describe the different testing modalities available for the ongoing Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemic including cell culture, nucleic acid amplification, antigen detection, and antibody detection assays. Applications of such tests in both acute clinical and epidemiological investigation settings are highlighted. Using the MERS epidemic as an example, we illustrate the various challenges faced by laboratories in test development and implementation in the setting of a rapidly emerging infectious disease. Future directions in the diagnosis of MERS and other emerging infectious disease investigations are also highlighted. © 2017, The Microbiological Society of Korea and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","coronavirus; diagnosis; epidemic; MERS; middle east","Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Coronaviridae; Coronavirus Infections; devices; epidemic; human; immunoassay; isolation and purification; laboratory test; molecular diagnosis; polymerase chain reaction; procedures; specimen handling; standards; virology; virus culture; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Epidemics; Humans; Immunoassay; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Specimen Handling; Virus Cultivation",,,,,,,,,,"Reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay for the detection of middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (2013) PLoS Curr, , Abd El Wahed, A., Patel, P., Heidenreich, D., Hufert, F.T., and Weidmann, M. 5, 10.1371/currents. outbreaks.62df1c7c75ffc96cd59034531e2e8364; Abroug, F., Slim, A., Ouanes-Besbes, L., Hadj Kacem, M.A., Dachraoui, F., Ouanes, I., Lu, X., Caidi, H., Family cluster of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections, Tunisia, 2013 (2014) Emerg.

Seasonal loads enforce huge work in limiting epidemic spread especially with new viruses such as MERS-CoV that is extended in the region. Early disease diagnosis applications developed using techniques such as data mining. Data mining is a scientific field that interest in discovering patterns and relationships between data items. Algorithms that used in this field helps to increase decision effectiveness. Classification used widely in disease diagnosis, where patients of heart disease diagnosed correctly using classification algorithms that proven to be efficient in later applications. In this paper three classification techniques employed to diagnose patients with MERS-CoV through early syndromes. Naive Bayesian, random forest, and support vector machine used to perform classification to patients’ databases. Successively results were very good in predicting patients with coronavirus infection using random forest classifier. Additionally results were equivalent to medical statistics that exhibit elders as the most probable infected sector of people. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Classification (of information);

This study retrieved 8,671,695 MERS-related online documents from May 20 to June 18, 2015, from 171 Korean online channels and analyzed such documents by using multilevel models and data mining with Apriori algorithm association analysis. We used R software (version 3.2.1) for the association analysis data mining and visualization. Buzz with negative emotions (i.e., anxiety or fear) was more prevalent in online discussion boards, Twitter, and online cafes than news sites and blogs. News buzz (b = 0.21, p < 0.001), but not rumor buzz (b = 0.06, p = 0.308), was associated with positive MERS emotions (i.e., being calm or composed). The mention of eating immunity-boosting food in the news led to a 94 percent chance of a positive MERS emotion and that such a chance of showing a positive emotion was 4.75 times higher than that without such a mention (support of 0.001, confidence of 0.94, and lift of 4.75). Even with the same precautionary messages that were disseminated, they yielded the opposite emotional reactions to people depending on the channel through which the messages were communicated. In the face of a novel and highly contagious disease such as MERS, the government must deploy a response system that includes provision and dissemination of reliable information and inhibits online diffusion of false information. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.","MERS; Social big data; Social networking","Coronavirus Infections; epidemic; human; information dissemination; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; procedures; social media; South Korea; statistics and numerical data; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Information Dissemination; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Republic of Korea; Social Media",,,,,,,,,,"(2013) Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus: Joint Kingdom of Saudi Arabia/ WHO Mission, , World Health Organization.

The aim of this study was to determine frequency and clinical influence of viral respiratory viruses as potential etiologic agents in episodes of FN in children. A total of 100 children (62 boys, 38 girls) with 166 FN episodes were included in this prospective study. Nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were analyzed for respiratory viral agents using multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. The origin of the fever could be defined in 111 (67%) of the episodes. We detected viral agents in 86 (51.8%), bacterial agents in 19 (11.4%), and fungal agents in 5 (3%) of the episodes. The most common detected viruses were rhinovirus (n= 27), respiratory syncytial virus (n=17), and coronavirus (n=16). Parainfluenza virus, influenza A and B, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, enterovirus, bocavirus and parechovirus were the remaining detected agents. More than one virus positivity occurred in 13 FN episodes. Forty-three patients had multiple FN episodes. Only four patients had the same viral agent in consecutive attacks. Respiratory symptoms (cough, nasal discharge and congestion, sneezing, wheezing), physical examination signs (rales and rhonchi) and radiological findings were significantly more common in viral agent positive patients (p < 0.05). This study showed that respiratory viruses make a substantial contribution on the etiology of FN episodes in children. Identifying viral agents may help to constitute individualized infection-management algorithms in these patients. © 2017, Turkish Journal of Pediatrics.

The novel virus belongs to the coronaviruses family, which is responsible for causing mild to moderate colds. The control and command center of Saudi Ministry of Health issues a daily report on MERS-CoV infection cases. The infection with MERS-CoV can lead to fatal complications, however little information is known about this novel virus. In this paper, we apply two data mining techniques in order to better understand the stability and the possibility of recovery from MERS-CoV infections. Method The Naive Bayes classifier and J48 decision tree algorithm were used to build our models. The dataset used consists of 1082 records of cases reported between 2013 and 2015. In order to build our prediction models, we split the dataset into two groups. The first group combined recovery and death records. A new attribute was created to indicate the record type, such that the dataset can be used to predict the recovery from MERS-CoV. The second group contained the new case records to be used to predict the stability of the infection based on the current status attribute. Results The resulting recovery models indicate that healthcare workers are more likely to survive. This could be due to the vaccinations that healthcare workers are required to get on regular basis. As for the stability models using J48, two attributes were found to be important for predicting stability: symptomatic and age. Old patients are at high risk of developing MERS-CoV complications. Finally, the performance of all the models was evaluated using three measures: accuracy, precision, and recall. In general, the accuracy of the models is between 53.6% and 71.58%. Conclusion We believe that the performance of the prediction models can be enhanced with the use of more patient data. As future work, we plan to directly contact hospitals in Riyadh in order to collect more information related to patients with MERS-CoV infections. © 2016 King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences","Classification; Data mining; Decision tree; J48; MERS-CoV; Naive Bayes","Article; Bayesian learning; classification algorithm; Coronavirus infection; data mining; decision tree; health care personnel; human; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; nonhuman; patient coding; predictive value; priority journal; aged; computer simulation; Coronavirus infection; data mining; female; male; middle aged; mortality; pathology; prognosis; Saudi Arabia; survival analysis; treatment outcome; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Computer Simulation; Coronavirus Infections; Data Mining; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Saudi Arabia; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome",,,,,"Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University","The project was scientifically supported by King Saud University, Deanship of Scientific research, research chairs and The Research Chair of Health Informatics and Promotion.",,,,"Coronavirus Website - Ministry of Health, , http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/, URL; Han, J., Kamber, M., Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques, 3rd Edition The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems (2011), Morgan Kaufmann; Suh, S.C., Practical Applications of Data Mining (2012), Jones & Bartlett Publishers; Ferreira, D., Oliveira, A., Freitas, A., Applying data mining techniques to improve diagnosis in neonatal jaundice (2012) BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making, 12, p. 143; Venkatalakshmi, B., Shivsankar, M., Heart disease diagnosis using predictive data mining, International Journal of Innovative Research in Science (2014) Engineering and Technology, 3, pp. 1873-1877; Majali, J., Niranjan, R., Phatak, V., Tadakhe, O., Data mining techniques for diagnosis and prognosis of cancer (2015) IJARCCE, 4 (3), pp. 613-615; Bellaachia, A., Guven, E., Predicting breast cancer survivability using data mining techniques, in: Ninth Workshop on Mining Scientific and Engineering Datasets in conjunction with the Sixth SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (2006); Afshar, H.L., Ahmadi, M., Roudbari, M., Sadoughi, F., Prediction of breast cancer survival through knowledge discovery in databases (2015) Global Journal of Health Science, 7 (4), p. 392; Sandhu, R., Sood, S.K., Kaur, G., An intelligent system for predicting and preventing MERS-CoV infection outbreak (2015) The Journal of Supecomputing, pp. 1-24; Quinlan, R., C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning (1993), Morgan Kaufmann Publishers San Mateo, CA; Hall, M., Frank, E., Holmes, G., Pfahringer, B., Reutemann, P., Wit-ten, I.H., The WEKA data mining software: an update (2009) SIGKDD Explor.

We estimated the relative risks of death and severe disease among MERS-CoV patients in the Middle East between 2012 and 2015 for several risk factors, using Poisson regression with robust variance and a bootstrap-based expectation maximization algorithm to handle extensive missing data. Increased age and underlying comorbidity were risk factors for both death and severe disease, while cases arising in Saudi Arabia were more likely to be severe. Cases occurring later in the emergence of MERS-CoV and among health-care workers were less serious. This study represents an attempt to estimate risk factors for an emerging infectious disease using open data and to address some of the uncertainty surrounding MERS-CoV epidemiology. © 2016 The Author.

Recent advances in viral detection techniques over the past decade have demonstrated viral LRTIs are associated with rates of morbidity, mortality, and health care utilization comparable to those of seen with bacterial community acquired and nosocomial pneumonias. In this review, we describe the relationship between viral LRTIs and critical illness, as well as discuss relevant clinical features and management strategies for the more prevalent respiratory viral pathogens. © SAGE Publications.","adenovirus; community acquired pneumonia; coronavirus; hospital acquired pneumonia; human metapneumovirus; influenza; intensive care unit; MERS; parainfluenza; respiratory syncytial virus; rhinovirus; SARS; viral respiratory infection","Adenoviridae; adenovirus infection; avian influenza; avian influenza virus; Bocaparvovirus; Bocavirus infection; clinical trial (topic); Coronaviridae; Coronaviridae infection; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; Ebolavirus; Enterovirus; Enterovirus D68; Enterovirus infection; Hantavirus; Hantavirus infection; human; Human metapneumovirus; Human metapneumovirus infection; Human respiratory syncytial virus; influenza; Influenza virus; intensive care; intensive care unit; meta analysis (topic); Mimivirus; nonhuman; Parainfluenza virus infection; Paramyxovirinae; prevalence; priority journal; respiratory syncytial virus infection; Review; Rhinovirus; Rhinovirus infection; viral respiratory tract infection; virus examination; adult; algorithm; artificial ventilation; Community-Acquired Infections; cross infection; disease management; intensive care unit; metabolism; organization and management; physiologic monitoring; procedures; Respiratory Tract Infections; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; virology; biological marker; Adult; Algorithms; Biomarkers; Community-Acquired Infections; Critical Care; Cross Infection; Disease Management; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Monitoring, Physiologic; Respiration, Artificial; Respiratory Tract Infections; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction",,"Biomarkers",,,,,,,,"(2014), http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/, The 10 leading causes of death in the world, 2000 and 2012; Web site.

Public Health England Birmingham Laboratory (PHEBL) is one of a few selected UK public health laboratories responsible for MERS-CoV screening in travellers returning to the UK from the Middle East who present to hospital with severe respiratory symptoms. The results of the PHEBL MERS-CoV screening and surveillance over the past 3 years is presented. Methods UK travellers/pilgrims who returned from the Middle East and presented to a hospital with respiratory symptoms were studied over the period February 1, 2013 to December 31, 2015. Patients with respiratory symptoms, who satisfied the Public Health England MERS-CoV case algorithm, were tested for MERS-CoV and other respiratory tract viruses on admission to hospital. Results Two hundred and two patients suspected of having MERS-CoV were tested. None of them had a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection. A viral aetiology was detected in half (50.3%) of the cases, with rhinoviruses, influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), and influenza B being most frequent. Peak testing occurred following the annual Hajj season and in other periods of raised national awareness. Conclusions Respiratory tract infections in travellers/pilgrims returning to the UK from the Middle East are mainly due to rhinoviruses, influenza A, and influenza B. Whilst MERS-CoV was not detected in the 202 patients studied, heightened awareness of the possibility of MERS-CoV and continuous proactive surveillance are essential to rapidly identify cases of MERS-CoV and other seasonal respiratory tract viruses such as avian influenza, in patients presenting to hospital. Early identification and isolation may prevent outbreaks in nosocomial settings. © 2016 The Author(s)","Mass gatherings; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV); Pilgrimage; Respiratory viruses; Surveillance","adolescent; adult; aged; Article; Brucella; child; controlled study; disease surveillance; Escherichia coli; female; human; Human metapneumovirus; Human respiratory syncytial virus; infant; influenza A (H1N1); influenza A (H3N2); influenza B; Legionella pneumophila; major clinical study; male; Middle East; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; newborn; prospective study; public health; respiratory tract infection; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Rhinovirus; Streptococcus pneumoniae; travel; United Kingdom; virus etiology; Coronavirus Infections; cross infection; England; epidemic; Influenza A virus (H1N1); Influenza A virus (H3N2); Influenza, Human; isolation and purification; middle aged; Respiratory Tract Infections; Saudi Arabia; South Korea; virology; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Coronavirus Infections; Cross Infection; Disease Outbreaks; England; Female; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype; Influenza, Human; Male; Middle Aged; Middle East; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Prospective Studies; Republic of Korea; Respiratory Tract Infections; Rhinovirus; Saudi Arabia; Travel; United Kingdom; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,"Zaki, A.M., van Boheemen, S., Bestebroer, T.M., Osterhaus, A.D., Fouchier, R.A., Isolation of a novel coronavirus from a man with pneumonia in Saudi Arabia (2012) New Engl J Med, 367, pp. 1814-1820; Hijawi, B., Abdallat, M., Sayaydeh, A., Algasrawi, S., Haddadin, A., Jarrour, N., Novel coronavirus infections in Jordan, April 2012: epidemiological findings from a retrospective investigation (2013) East Mediterr Health J, 19, pp. S12-S18; Zumla, A., Hui, D.S., Perlman, S., (2015) Seminar: Middle East respiratory syndrome.

On May 20, 2015, it has massively occurred in Republic of Korea, with 186 confirmed cases, 36 deaths. In this paper, we analyzed some features of MERS-CoV's transmission route by a new molecular approach. We have collected DNA sequences of MERS-CoV from 15 different regions in the world, including some regions of KSA. We have converted the DNA sequences into amino acid sequences and used Apriori and Decision Tree Algorithm to found the similarities and differences between different MERS-CoVs' amino acid sequences. Then, we drew some conclusions about MERS's transmission routes by using these results. © 2016 Global IT Research Institute (GiRI).","Apriori; Decision Tree Algorithm; epidemiological investigation; MERS; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome; transmission route","Algorithms; Amino acids; Bioinformatics; Decision trees; DNA sequences; Trees (mathematics); Apriori; Decision-tree algorithm; epidemiological investigation; MERS; Middle East; Transmission route; Data mining",,,,,,,,,,"De Groot, R.J., Baker, S.C., Baric, R.S., Brown, C.S., Drosten, C., Enjuanes, L., Fouchier, R.A.M., Ziebuhr, J., Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV): Announcement of the coronavirus study Group (2013) Journal of Virology, 87 (14), pp. 7790-7792; Ki, M., 2015 MERS outbreak in korea: Hospital-to-hospital transmission (2015) Epidemiol Health Epidemiology and Health, 37; (2015) Summary of Current Situation, Literature Update and Risk Assessment, , WHO, WHO/MERS/RA/15. 1; Azhar, E.I., El-Kafrawy, S.A., Farraj, S.A., Hassan, A.M., Al-Saeed, M.S., Hashem, A.M., Tariq Madani, A.M.D., Evidence for camel-to-human transmission of MERS coronavirus (2014) New England Journal of Medicine N Engl J Med, 370, pp. 2499-2505; Cotten, M., Watson, S.J., Zumla, A.I., Makhdoom, H.Q., Palser, A.L., Ong, S.H., Al Rabeeah, A.A., Memish, Z.A., Spread, circulation, and evolution of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (2014) M5o. 01062-13; Perera, R.A., Wang, P., Gomaa, M.R., El-Shesheny, R., Kandeil, B.O., Siu, L.Y., Shehata, M.M., Kayali, G., Seroepidemiology for MERS coronavirus using microneutralisation and pseudoparticle virus neutralisation assays reveal a high prevalence of antibody in dromedary camels in Egypt (2013) Euro Surveill, 18, pp. 20574-22057; Zaki, A.M.I., Van Boheemen, S., Bestebroer, T.M., Osterhaus, A.D., Fouchier, R.A., Isolation of a novel coronavirus from a man with pneumonia in Saudi Arabia (2012) N Engl J Med, 367 (19), pp. 1814-1820; Durai, P., Batool, M., Shah, M., Choi, S., Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Transmission, virology and therapeutic targeting to aid in outbreak control (2015) Experimental & Molecular Medicine Exp Mol Med, 47 (8); State of knowledge and data gaps of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Humans (2013) PLoS CurrPLoS Currents, , Group, The Who Mers-Cov Research; Woo, P.C., Lau, S.K., Li, K.S., Tsang, A.K., Yuen, K.Y., Genetic relatedness of the novel human group C betacoronavirus to Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5 (2012) Emerg Microbes Infect, 1, p. e35; Kayali, G., Peiris, M., A more detailed picture of the epidemiology of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (2015) Lancet Infect Dis, 15, pp. 495-497; Milne-Price, S., Miazgowicz, K.L., Munster, V.J., The emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (2014) Pathog Dis, 71, pp. 121-136; Xia, S., Liu, Q., Wang, Q., Sun, Z., Su, S., Du, L., Ying, T., Jiang, S., Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) entry inhibitors targeting spike protein (2014) Virus Res, 194, pp. 200-210; Lu, G., Hu, Y., Wang, Q., Qi, J., Gao, F., Li, Y., Molecular basis of binding between novel human coronavirus MERS-CoV and its receptor CD26 (2013) Nature, 500, pp. 227-231; Jung, C., Jeong, C., Yoon, T., Analyzing the DNA Sequences Differences of Family Adenoviridae to Track out the Inner Amine Protein Features by Using Apriori Algorithm (2014) Journal of Life Sciences and Technologies JOLST, 2 (1); Bae, J., Lee, J., Jang, Y., Boo, S., Lee, S., Comparison of HIV-1 SIV-1, and SHIV in protein translation using apriori algorithm (2015) Journal of Medical and Bioengineering, 4 (2). , April; Heo, C., Kim, D., Yoon, T., In-depth understanding of Norovirus and Rotavirus by employing Apriori algorithm in case of DNA sequence (2014) International Journal of Information and Electronics Engineering, 4 (5). , September; Go, E., Lee, S., Yoon, T., Analysis of ebolavirus with decision tree and apriori algorithm (2014) International Journal of Machine Learning and Computing, 4 (6). , December; Baek, J., Kim, K., Kim, S., Kim, C., Adaptive decision tree algorithm for data mining in real-time machine status database (2000) Journal of the Korean Institute of Industrial Engineers, 26 (2), pp. 171-182. , June; Lee, G., (2003) Improvement of Accuracy of Decision Tree by Reprocessing, , Korea Information Processing Society; Butler, D., MERS cases spotlight lack of research (2015) Nature, , 09 June; Kiskowski, M., A three-scale network model for the early growth dynamics of 2014 west Africa ebola epidemic (2014) PLoS Curr PLoS Currents; Papini, M., Maria Piraccini, B., Difonzo, E., Brunoro, A., Epidemiology of onychomycosis in Italy: Prevalence data and risk factor identification, , A<yco.

In poultry, the genetic diversity, evolution, distribution and taxonomy of some coronaviruses have been well described, but little is known about the features of CoVs in wild birds. In this study we screened 764 samples from 22 avian species of the orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes in Sweden collected in 2006/2007 for CoV, with an overall CoV prevalence of 18.7%, which is higher than many other wild bird surveys. The highest prevalence was found in the diving ducksmainly Greater Scaup (Aythya marila; 51.5%)- and the dabbling duck Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos; 19.2%). Sequences from two of the Greater Scaup CoV fell into an infrequently detected lineage, shared only with a Tufted Duck (Aythya fuligula) CoV. Coronavirus sequences from Mallards in this study were highly similar to CoV sequences from the sample species and location in 2011, suggesting long-term maintenance in this population. A single Black-headed Gull represented the only positive sample from the order Charadriiformes. Globally, Anas species represent the largest fraction of avian CoV sequences, and there seems to be no host species, geographical or temporal structure. To better understand the eitiology, epidemiology and ecology of these viruses more systematic surveillance of wild birds and subsequent sequencing of detected CoV is imperative. © 2016 Wille et al.

Recent theoretical work has focused on making best use of data from the initial exponential phase of growth of incidence in large populations. Methods We measured generational transmissibility by the basic reproductive number R0 and the serial interval by its mean Tg. First, we constructed a simulation algorithm for case data arising from a small population of known size with R0 and Tg also known. We then developed an inferential model for the likelihood of these case data as a function of R0 and Tg. The model was designed to capture a) any signal of the serial interval distribution in the initial stochastic phase b) the growth rate of the exponential phase and c) the unique combination of R0 and Tg that generates a specific shape of peak incidence when the susceptible portion of a small population is depleted. Findings Extensive repeat simulation and parameter estimation revealed no bias in univariate estimates of either R0 and Tg.We were also able to simultaneously estimate both R0 and Tg. However, accurate final estimates could be obtained only much later in the outbreak. In particular, estimates of Tg were considerably less accurate in the bivariate case until the peak of incidence had passed. Conclusions The basic reproductive number and mean serial interval can be estimated simultaneously in real time during an outbreak of an emerging pathogen. Repeated application of these methods to small scale outbreaks at the start of an epidemic would permit accurate estimates of key parameters. © 2016 Wu, Riley.

Recent findings Although a significant proportion of PLWH are aged over 50, the relative importance of low BMD to clinical care differs significantly between countries and regions, based on factors such as the population at risk, access to adequate screening resources, and physicians' knowledge. Generally, management of osteoporosis in PLWH follows similar principals as for the general population, with risk factors for fracture combined with measurement of BMD by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry in algorithms such as Fracture Risk Assessment Tool, designed to provide an overall risk estimation. Although in most regions age is considered among the most important factors contributing to low BMD and fractures, considerable country and region-specific factors become apparent, such as malnutrition, inactivity and impact of comorbidities, substance abuse, and increasing use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Summary These opinions highlight the diversity that still exists in the approach to the long-term management of PLWH and highlight challenges facing development of consensus guidelines that can be effectively implemented worldwide. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Additional NCBI resources focus on literature (PubMed Central (PMC), Bookshelf and PubReader), health (ClinVar, dbGaP, dbMHC, the Genetic Testing Registry, HIV-1/Human Protein Interaction Database and MedGen), genomes (BioProject, Assembly, Genome, BioSample, dbSNP, dbVar, Epigenomics, the Map Viewer, Nucleotide, Probe, RefSeq, Sequence Read Archive, the Taxonomy Browser and the Trace Archive), genes (Gene, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), HomoloGene, PopSet and UniGene), proteins (Protein, the Conserved Domain Database (CDD), COBALT, Conserved Domain Architecture Retrieval Tool (CDART), the Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB) and Protein Clusters) and chemicals (Biosystems and the Pub-Chem suite of small molecule databases). The Entrez system provides search and retrieval operations for most of these databases. Augmenting many of the web applications are custom implementations of the BLAST program optimized to search specialized datasets.

However, analytical methods to support NGS platforms are not as uniformly available. Pathosphere (found at Pathosphere.org) is a cloud - based open - sourced community tool that allows for communication, collaboration and sharing of NGS analytical tools and data amongst scientists working in academia, industry and government. The architecture allows for users to upload data and run available bioinformatics pipelines without the need for onsite processing hardware or technical support. Results: The pathogen detection capabilities hosted on Pathosphere were tested by analyzing pathogen-containing samples sequenced by NGS with both spiked human samples as well as human and zoonotic host backgrounds. Pathosphere analytical pipelines developed by Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC) identified spiked pathogens within a common sample analyzed by 454, Ion Torrent, and Illumina sequencing platforms. ECBC pipelines also correctly identified pathogens in human samples containing arenavirus in addition to animal samples containing flavivirus and coronavirus. These analytical methods were limited in the detection of sequences with limited homology to previous annotations within NCBI databases, such as parvovirus. Utilizing the pipeline-hosting adaptability of Pathosphere, the analytical suite was supplemented by analytical pipelines designed by the United States Army Medical Research Insititute of Infectious Diseases and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (USAMRIID-WRAIR). These pipelines were implemented and detected parvovirus sequence in the sample that the ECBC iterative analysis previously failed to identify. Conclusions: By accurately detecting pathogens in a variety of samples, this work demonstrates the utility of Pathosphere and provides a platform for utilizing, modifying and creating pipelines for a variety of NGS technologies developed to detect pathogens in complex sample backgrounds. These results serve as an exhibition for the existing pipelines and web-based interface of Pathosphere as well as the plug-in adaptability that allows for integration of newer NGS analytical software as it becomes available. © 2015 Kilianski et al.",,"Bioinformatics;

MERS-CoV has been shown to spread between people who are in close contact. Transmission from infected patients to healthcare personnel has also been observed and is irredeemable with present technology. Genetic studies on MERS-CoV have shown that ORF1ab encodes replicase polyproteins and play a foremost role in viral infection. Therefore, ORF1ab replicase polyprotein may be used as a suitable target for disease control. Viral activity can be controlled by RNA interference (RNAi) technology, a leading method for post transcriptional gene silencing in a sequence-specific manner. However, there is a genetic inconsistency in different viral isolates; it is a great challenge to design potential RNAi (miRNA and siRNA) molecules which can silence the respective target genes rather than any other viral gene simultaneously. In the current study, four effective miRNA and five siRNA molecules for silencing of nine different strains of MERS-CoV were rationally designed and corroborated using computational methods, which might lead to knockdown the activity of virus. siRNA and miRNA molecules were predicted against ORF1ab gene of different strains of MERS-CoV as effective candidate using computational methods. Thus, this method may provide an insight for the chemical synthesis of antiviral RNA molecule for the treatment of MERS-CoV, at genomic level. © 2015, International Association of Scientists in the Interdisciplinary Areas and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Antiviral; Computational method; Gene silencing; MERS-CoV; RNAi","microRNA; small interfering RNA; algorithm; biology; conformation; DNA base composition; gene silencing; genetics; metabolism; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; nucleotide sequence; procedures; thermodynamics; Algorithms; Base Composition; Base Sequence; Computational Biology; Gene Silencing; MicroRNAs; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Nucleic Acid Conformation; RNA, Small Interfering; Thermodynamics",,"MicroRNAs; RNA, Small Interfering",,,,,,,,"Orbalenya, A.E., Enjuanes, L., Ziebuhr, J., Snijder, E.J., Nidovirales: evolving the largest RNA virus genome (2006) Virus Res, 117, pp. 17-37; Wertheim, J.O., Chu, D.K., Peiris, J.S., Kosakovsky Pond, S.L., Poon, L.L., A case for the ancient origin of coronaviruses (2013) J Virol, 87, pp. 7039-7045. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3sXptlKrsLo%3D, PID: 23596293; De Groot, R.J., Bake, S.C., Baric, R.S., Brown, C.S., Drosten, C., Enjuanes, L., Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV): announcement of the Coronavirus Study Group (2013) J Virol, 87, pp. 7790-7792. , PID: 23678167; Memish, Z.A., Zumla, A., Assiri, A., Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections in health care workers (2013) N Engl J Med, 369, pp. 884-886. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3sXhtlyisLzN, PID: 23923992; Zaki, A.M., Van Boheemen, S., Bestebroer, T.M., Osterhaus, A.D., Fouchier, R.A., Isolation of a novel coronavirus from a man with pneumonia in Saudi Arabia (2012) N Engl J Med, 367, pp. 1814-1820. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC38Xhs1ekt73P, PID: 23075143; Hui, D.S., Alimuddin, Z., Advancing priority research on the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (2014) J Infect Dis, 209, pp. 173-176. , PID: 24218505; Guery, B., Poissy, J., Mansouf, L., Sejourne, C., Ettahar, N., Lemaire, X., Clinical features and viral diagnosis of two cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: a report of nosocomial transmission (2013) Lancet, 38, pp. 2265-2272; Assiri, A., McGeer, A., Perl, T., Price, C., Al Rabeeah, A., Cummings, D., Hospital outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (2013) N Engl J Med, 369, pp. 407-416. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3sXht1GmsrrL, PID: 23782161; Annan, A., Baldwin, H.J., Corman, V.M., Klose, S.M., Owusu, M., Nkrumah, E.E., Human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012-related viruses in bats, Ghana and Europe (2013) Emerg Infect Dis, 19, pp. 456-459. , PID: 23622767; Eckerle, I., Corman, V.M., Müller, M.A., Lenk, M., Ulrich, R.G., Drosten, C., Replicative capacity of MERS coronavirus in livestock cell lines (2014) Emerg Infect Dis, 20, pp. 276-279. , PID: 24457147; Müller, M.A., Raj, V.S., Muth, D., Meyer, B., Kallies, S., Smits, S.L., Human coronavirus EMC does not require the SARS-coronavirus receptor and maintains broad replicative capability in mammalian cell lines (2012) MBio, 3, pp. 512-515; Eric, J.Z., Alexander, E.S., Gorbalenya, E., Virus-encoded proteinases and proteolytic processing in the Nidovirales (2000) J Gen Virol, 81, pp. 853-879; Van Bohemeen, S., De Graaf, M., Lauber, C., Bestebroer, T.M., Raj, V.S., Zaki, A.M., Genomic characterization of a newly discovered coronavirus associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome in humans (2012) MBio, 3. , e00473-12; Pasternak, A.O., Spaan, W.J., Snijder, E.J., Nidovirus transcription: how to make sense…?

For a given DNA sequence, a binary indicator sequence of each nucleotide is constructed, and Discrete Fourier Transform is applied on these four sequences to attain respective power spectra. Mathematical moments are built from these spectra, and multidimensional vectors of real numbers are constructed from these moments. Cluster analysis is then performed in order to determine the evolutionary relationship between DNA sequences. The novelty of this method is that sequences with different lengths can be compared easily via the use of power spectra and moments. Experimental results on various datasets show that the proposed method provides an efficient tool to classify genes and genomes. It not only gives comparable results but also is remarkably faster than other multiple sequence alignment and alignment-free methods. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Genes; Moments; Phylogenetic trees","HN protein; mitochondrial DNA; DNA; mitochondrial DNA; cluster analysis; DNA; Fourier transform; gene; phylogenetics; Article; cluster analysis; controlled study; Discrete Fourier Transform; DNA sequence; Fourier transformation; gene cluster; host range; human; Human rhinovirus; Influenza virus A; infrared spectroscopy; mathematical analysis; mitochondrial genome; nonhuman; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; priority journal; scoring system; sequence alignment; serotype; signal processing; virus genome; algorithm; animal; bacterial genome; bacterium; biological model; biology; Coronaviridae; DNA sequence; Fourier analysis; genetics; genome; image processing; Influenza A virus; molecular evolution; procedures; Rhinovirus; Algorithms; Animals; Bacteria; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; Coronavirus; DNA; DNA, Mitochondrial; Evolution, Molecular; Fourier Analysis; Genome; Genome, Bacterial; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Influenza A virus; Models, Genetic; Phylogeny; Rhinovirus; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA",,"DNA, 9007-49-2; DNA; DNA, Mitochondrial",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH: 5 SC3 GM098180-04

Accumulation of such data (e.g., genomics, proteomics, metabolomics etc.) is fast becoming more common and thus requires the development and implementation of effective data mining strategies designed for biological and clinical applications. Multiplex microbead immunoassay (MMIA), on xMAP or MagPix platform (Luminex), which is amenable to automation, offers a major advantage over conventional methods such as Western blot or ELISA, for increasing the efficiencies in serodiagnosis of infectious diseases. MMIA allows detection of antibodies and/or antigens efficiently for a wide range of infectious agents simultaneously in host blood samples, in one reaction vessel. In the process, MMIA generates large volumes of data. In this report we demonstrate the application of data mining tools on how the inherent large volume data can improve the assay tolerance (measured in terms of sensitivity and specificity) by analysis of experimental data accumulated over a span of two years. The combination of prior knowledge with machine learning tools provides an efficient approach to improve the diagnostic power of the assay in a continuous basis. Furthermore, this study provides an in-depth knowledge base to study pathological trends of infectious agents in mouse colonies on a multivariate scale. Data mining techniques using serodetection of infections in mice, developed in this study, can be used as a general model for more complex applications in epidemiology and clinical translational research. © 2015 Mani et al.",,"animal cell;

The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) less than 10 years later demonstrates the potential of coronaviruses to cross species boundaries and further highlights the importance of identifying novel lead compounds with broad spectrum activity. The coronavirus 3CLpro provides a highly validated drug target and as there is a high degree of sequence homology and conservation in main chain architecture the design of broad spectrum inhibitors is viable. The ZINC drugs-now library was screened in a consensus high-throughput pharmacophore modeling and molecular docking approach by Vina, Glide, GOLD and MM-GBSA. Molecular dynamics further confirmed results obtained from structure-based techniques. A highly defined hit-list of 19 compounds was identified by the structure-based drug design methodologies. As these compounds were extensively validated by a consensus approach and by molecular dynamics, the likelihood that at least one of these compounds is bioactive is excellent. Additionally, the compounds segregate into 15 significantly dissimilar (p < 0.05) clusters based on shape and features, which represent valuable scaffolds that can be used as a basis for future anti-coronaviral inhibitor discovery experiments. Importantly though, the enriched subset of 19 compounds identified from the larger library has to be validated experimentally. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","3CLpro; Human coronaviruses; Molecular docking; Molecular dynamics; Structure-based drug design; Virtual screening","antivirus agent; protein 3CLpro; proteinase; proteinase inhibitor; unclassified drug; 3C-like protease, SARS coronavirus; antivirus agent; cysteine proteinase; cysteine proteinase inhibitor; viral protein; algorithm; Article; binding affinity; computer program; Coronaviridae; Coronaviridae infection; drug design; drug screening; drug targeting; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; molecular mechanics; nonhuman; pharmacophore; sequence homology; virtual reality; X ray crystallography; antagonists and inhibitors; chemistry; drug effects; human; isolation and purification; preclinical study; procedures; Antiviral Agents; Coronavirus; Cysteine Endopeptidases; Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors; Drug Design; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Humans; Molecular Docking Simulation; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Viral Proteins",,"proteinase, 9001-92-7; proteinase inhibitor, 37205-61-1; cysteine proteinase, 37353-41-6; 3C-like protease, SARS coronavirus; Antiviral Agents; Cysteine Endopeptidases; Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors; Viral Proteins",,,,,,,,"McIntosh, K., Coronaviruses in the limelight (2005) J.

Effectiveness was measured by: (a) reduction in the number of patients admitted into the MERS-CoV tracking system; (b) identification of positive MERS-CoV cases; (c) containment of cross infectivity; and (d) increased efficiency in ED functioning. Methods A retrospective chart review was carried out of all ED patients suspected of MERS-CoV during the height of the epidemic (August to October 2013). An algorithm was created on the basis of international guidelines to screen and triage suspected MERS-CoV patients. Once identified, patients were isolated, had a chest roentgenogram [chest radiography (CXR)] taken, and a nasopharyngeal swab for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was sent with sputum samples for testing. Patients with normal CXR and mild respiratory symptoms were discharged with home isolation instructions until nasopharyngeal and sputum PCR results were available. Patients with fever and acute respiratory distress, with or without abnormal CXR, were treated in the hospital until tests proved negative for MERS-CoV. Results The protocol successfully reduced the number of patients who needed to be tested for MERS-CoV from 12 563 to 514, identified seven positive cases, and did not lead to apparent cross infectivity that resulted in serious illness or death. The protocol also increased the efficiency of ED and cut the turnaround time for nasopharyngeal swab and sputum results from 3 days to 1 day. Conclusion A highly protocolized surveillance system limited the impact of MERS-CoV on ED functioning by identifying and prioritizing high-risk patients. The emergence of new infectious diseases requires constant monitoring of interventions to reduce the impact of epidemics on population health and health services.

We present the rationale for the public health response to both incidents, and report results of contact tracing. Following a risk assessment, passengers seated two seats around the cases were prioritised for contact tracing and a proactive media approach was used to alert all passengers on the planes of their possible exposure in both incidents. In total, 64 United Kingdom (UK) residents were successfully contacted, 14 of whom were sat in the priority area two seats all around the case(s). Five passengers reported respiratory symptoms within 14 days of the flight, but all tested were negative for MERSCoV. Details of non-UK residents were passed on to relevant World Health Organization International Health Regulation focal points for follow-up, and no further cases were reported back. Different approaches were used to manage contact tracing for each flight due to variations in the quality and timeliness of the passenger contact information provided by the airlines involved.

The pattern of spread of the SARS virus can be likened to a tree called a phylogenetic tree. All of SARS virus related to one another are connected to a network that is transmitted from one individual to another. The results of this branching process to determine the beginning of the epidemic as well as the host of the corona virus. To construct a phylogenetic tree takes inputs in the form of a distance matrix. In this study the distance matrix is derived from the alignments between sequence by using Super Pairwise Alignment (SPA). The output of the alignment is in the form of number of differences of sequences that determine in genetic distance. From the distance matrix, the genetic distance is converted to evolutionary distances using the Jukes Cantor model of which was established by phylogenetic tree by using the neighbor joining algorithm. From the results of the phylogenetic tree formation are known as host SARS Co-V is a palm civet with evolutionary distance of 0.1314. The epidemic began on December 16, 2002 in Guangzhou of South China and then spread to Zhongshan. Rallying point of the epidemic in Guangzhou Hospital and the Metropole hotel subsequently spread to Hanoi, Toronto, Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong so that SARS to be international case. Furthermore, from the result of alignments of hosts and human SARS Co-V with SPA is known that the mutation is a mutation that occurs with type I protein replacement at position 77, 139, 147, 244, 344, 360, 472, 480, 487, 577, 609, 613, 665, 765, 778, and 1163. © 2005 - 2015 JATIT & LLS.

As most (re-)emerging viral infections originate from animal sources, it is important to obtain insight into viral pathogens present in the wildlife reservoir from a public health perspective. When monitoring living, free-ranging wildlife for viruses, sample collection can be challenging and availability of nucleic acids isolated from samples is often limited. The development of viral metagenomics platforms allows a more comprehensive inventory of viruses present in wildlife. We report a metagenomic viral survey of the Western Arctic herd of barren ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) in Alaska, USA. The presence of mammalian viruses in eye and nose swabs of 39 free-ranging caribou was investigated by random amplification combined with a metagenomic analysis approach that applied exhaustive iterative assembly of sequencing results to define taxonomic units of each metagenome. Through homology search methods we identified the presence of several mammalian viruses, including different papillomaviruses, a novel parvovirus, polyomavirus, and a virus that potentially represents a member of a novel genus in the family Coronaviridae.",,"algorithm;

From 1960, six strains of human coronaviruses have emerged that includes SARS-CoV and the recent infection by deadly MERS-CoV which is now going to cause another outbreak. Prevention of these viruses is urgent and a universal vaccine for all strain could be a promising solution in this circumstance. In this study we aimed to design an epitope based vaccine against all strain of human coronavirus.Results: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) approach was employed among spike (S), membrane (M), enveloped (E) and nucleocapsid (N) protein and replicase polyprotein 1ab to identify which one is highly conserve in all coronaviruses strains. Next, we use various in silico tools to predict consensus immunogenic and conserved peptide. We found that conserved region is present only in the RNA directed RNA polymerase protein. In this protein we identified one epitope WDYPKCDRA is highly immunogenic and 100% conserved among all available human coronavirus strains.Conclusions: Here we suggest in vivo study of our identified novel peptide antigen in RNA directed RNA polymerase protein for universal vaccine - which may be the way to prevent all human coronavirus disease. © 2014 Sharmin and Islam; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Coronavirus; Epitope; MERS-CoV; RNA directed RNA polymerase; SARS-CoV; Universal vaccine","Diseases; Peptides; Polymers; RNA; Strain; Vaccines; Viruses; Conserved regions; Coronaviruses; MERS-CoV; Multiple sequence alignments; Novel peptides; Nucleocapsids; Rna-directed rna polymerase; SARS-CoV; Epitopes; Coronavirus; RNA viruses; SARS coronavirus; epitope; RNA directed RNA polymerase; virus protein; virus vaccine; algorithm; amino acid sequence; article; chemistry; Coronavirus; enzymology; human; immunology; nucleotide sequence; sequence alignment; Algorithms; Amino Acid Sequence; Conserved Sequence; Coronavirus; Epitopes; Humans; RNA Replicase; Sequence Alignment; Viral Proteins; Viral Vaccines",,"RNA directed RNA polymerase, 9026-28-2",,,,,,,,"Luis, E., Isabel, S., Sonia, Z., Fernando, A., Coronavirus Replication and Interaction with Host (2008) Animal Viruses: Molecular Biology, pp. 149-202. , UK: Caister Academic Press; De Groot, R.J., Baker, S.C., Baric, R., Enjuanes, L., Gorbalenya, A.E., Holmes, K.V., Perlman, S., Ziebuhr, J., Family Coronaviridae (2011) International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.

In response, we developed two real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays targeting the MERS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) gene and evaluated these assays as a panel with a previously published assay targeting the region upstream of the MERS-CoV envelope gene (upE) for the detection and confirmation of MERS-CoV infection. All assays detected< 10 copies/reaction of quantified RNA transcripts, with a linear dynamic range of 8 log units and 1.3103 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50)/ml of cultured MERS-CoV per reaction. All assays performed comparably with respiratory, serum, and stool specimens spiked with cultured virus. No false-positive amplifications were obtained with other human coronaviruses or common respiratory viral pathogens or with 336 diverse clinical specimens from non-MERS-CoV cases; specimens from two confirmed MERS-CoV cases were positive with all assay signatures. In June 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized emergency use of the rRT-PCR assay panel as an in vitro diagnostic test for MERS-CoV. A kit consisting of the three assay signatures and a positive control was assembled and distributed to public health laboratories in the United States and internationally to support MERS-CoV surveillance and public health responses.

This graphical representation not only avoids degeneracy, but also has good visualization no matter how long these sequences are, and can reflect the length of protein sequence. Then we transform the 2D-graphical representation into a numerical characterization that can facilitate quantitative comparison of protein sequences. The utility of this approach is illustrated by two examples: one is similarity/dissimilarity comparison among different ND6 protein sequences based on their DV-curve figures the other is the phylogenetic analysis among coronaviruses based on their spike proteins. © 2014 Wei Deng and Yihui Luan.",,"membrane protein;

Metagenomic approaches are increasingly used in the detection of novel viral pathogens but also to generate complete genomes of uncultivated viruses. In silico identification of complete viral genomes from sequence data would allow rapid phylogenetic characterization of these new viruses. Often, however, complete viral genomes are not recovered, but rather several distinct contigs derived from a single entity are, some of which have no sequence homology to any known proteins. De novo assembly of single viruses from a metagenome is challenging, not only because of the lack of a reference genome, but also because of intrapopulation variation and uneven or insufficient coverage. Here we explored different assembly algorithms, remote homology searches, genome-specific sequence motifs, k-mer frequency ranking, and coverage profile binning to detect and obtain viral target genomes from metagenomes. All methods were tested on 454-generated sequencing datasets containing three recently described RNA viruses with a relatively large genome which were divergent to previously known viruses from the viral families Rhabdoviridae and Coronaviridae. Depending on specific characteristics of the target virus and the metagenomic community, different assembly and in silico gap closure strategies were successful in obtaining near complete viral genomes. © 2014 Smits, Bodewes, Ruiz-Gonzalez, Baumgärtner, Koopmans, Osterhaus and Schürch.","Assembly; Metagenome; Pathogen; Viral metagenomics; Virome; Virus; Virus discovery","algorithm; Article; barrel medic; Clostridium thermocellum; Coronavirus; gene frequency; gene structure; gene targeting; lung parenchyma; metagenome; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Rhabdoviridae; RNA virus; sensitivity and specificity; sequence homology; viral genetics; virus assembly; virus genome; Coronaviridae; Rhabdoviridae; RNA viruses","GENBANK: KF823814, KF958252, KJ935003",,,,,,,,,"Albertsen, M., Hugenholtz, P., Skarshewski, A., Nielsen, K.L., Tyson, G.W., Nielsen, P.H., Genome sequences of rare, uncultured bacteria obtained by differential coverage binning of multiple metagenomes (2013) Nat.

Despite immense potential, a viral siRNA efficacy prediction algorithm is still not available. Moreover, performances of the existing general mammalian siRNA efficacy predictors are not satisfactory for viral siRNAs. Therefore, we have developed "" VIRsiRNApred"" a support vector machine (SVM) based method for predicting the efficacy of viral siRNA. Methods: In the present study, we have employed a new dataset of 1725 viral siRNAs with experimentally verified quantitative efficacies tested under heterogeneous experimental conditions and targeting as many as 37 important human viruses including HIV, Influenza, HCV, HBV, SARS etc. These siRNAs were divided into training (T1380) and validation (V345) datasets. Important siRNA sequence features including mono to penta nucleotide frequencies, binary pattern, thermodynamic properties and secondary structure were employed for model development. Results: During 10-fold cross validation on T1380 using hybrid approach, we achieved a maximum Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.55 between predicted and actual efficacy of viral siRNAs. On V345 independent dataset, our best model achieved a maximum correlation of 0.50 while existing general siRNA prediction methods showed PCC from 0.05 to 0.18. However, using leave one out cross validation PCC was improved to 0.58 and 0.55 on training and validation datasets respectively. SVM performed better than other machine learning techniques used like ANN, KNN and REP Tree. Conclusion: VIRsiRNApred is the first algorithm for predicting inhibition efficacy of viral siRNAs which is developed using experimentally verified viral siRNAs. We hope this algorithm would be useful in predicting highly potent viral siRNA to aid siRNA based antiviral therapeutics development.

Though various fast Smith-Waterman implementations are developed, they are either designed as monolithic protein database searching tools, which do not return detailed alignment, or are embedded into other tools. These issues make reusing these efficient Smith-Waterman implementations impractical. Results: To facilitate easy integration of the fast Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data Smith-Waterman algorithm into third-party software, we wrote a C/C++ library, which extends Farrar's Striped Smith-Waterman (SSW) to return alignment information in addition to the optimal Smith-Waterman score. In this library we developed a new method to generate the full optimal alignment results and a suboptimal score in linear space at little cost of efficiency. This improvement makes the fast Single-Instruction-Multiple- Data Smith-Waterman become really useful in genomic applications. SSW is available both as a C/C++ software library, as well as a stand-alone alignment tool at: https://github.com/mengyao/Complete-Striped-Smith-Waterman-Library. Conclusions: The SSW library has been used in the primary read mapping tool MOSAIK, the split-read mapping program SCISSORS, the MEI detector TANGRAM, and the read-overlap graph generation program RZMBLR. The speeds of the mentioned software are improved significantly by replacing their ordinary Smith-Waterman or banded Smith-Waterman module with the SSW Library. © 2013 Zhao et al.",,"amino acid sequence; article; bacterial genome; computer language; computer program; controlled study; Escherichia coli; gene sequence; genetic algorithm; human; human genome; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; SARS coronavirus; sequence alignment; Toxoplasma gondii; virus genome; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Databases, Protein; Genomics; Programming Languages; Sequence Alignment; Time Factors","GENBANK: P07756, P14942, P19096, P42357",,,,"National Human Genome Research Institute, NHGRI: R01 HG4719",,,,,"Smith, T.F., Waterman, M.S., Identification of common molecular subsequences (1981) J Mol Biol, 147, pp. 195-197. , doi: 10.1016/0022-2836(81)90087-5.

Currently, many viruses can be identified by sequencing without knowledge of the pathogenicity of the virus. However, attributing the presence of a virus in patient material to a disease in the patient can be a challenge. One approach to meet this challenge is identification of viral sequences based on enrichment by autologous patient antibody capture. This method facilitates identification of viruses that have provoked an immune response within the patient and may increase the sensitivity of the current virus discovery techniques. To demonstrate the utility of this method, virus discovery deep sequencing (VIDISCA-454) was performed on clinical samples from 19 patients: 13 with a known respiratory viral infection and 6 with a known gastrointestinal viral infection. Patient sera was collected from one to several months after the acute infection phase. Input and antibody capture material was sequenced and enrichment was assessed. In 18 of the 19 patients, viral reads from immunogenic viruses were enriched by antibody capture (ranging between 1.5x to 343x in respiratory material, and 1.4x to 53x in stool). Enriched reads were also determined in an identity independent manner by using a novel algorithm Xcompare. In 16 of the 19 patients, 21% to 100% of the enriched reads were derived from infecting viruses. In conclusion, the technique provides a novel approach to specifically identify immunogenic viral sequences among the bulk of sequences which are usually encountered during virus discovery metagenomics. © 2013 Oude Munnink et al.",,"autoantibody;

T cell epitope mapping strategies increasingly rely on algorithms that predict the binding of peptides to MHC molecules. There is, however, little information on the reliability of predictive algorithms in the context of human populations, in particular, for those expressing HLA class I molecules for which there are limited experimental data available. In this study, we evaluate the ability of NetMHCpan to predict antiviral CD8+ T cell epitopes that we identified with a traditional approach in patients of Asian ethnicity infected with Dengue virus, hepatitis B virus, or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. We experimentally demonstrate that the predictive power of algorithms defining peptide-MHC interaction directly correlates with the amount of training data on which the predictive algorithm has been constructed. These results highlight the limited applicability of the NetMHCpan algorithm for populations expressing HLA molecules for which there are little or no experimental binding data, such as those of Asian ethnicity.

RNA viruses pose an interesting case study given their mutation rates are orders of magnitude higher than any other pathogen - as reflected by the recent emergence of SARS and Influenza for example. Here, we show how feature selection techniques can be used to reliably classify viral sequences by host species, and to identify the crucial minority of host-specific sites in pathogen genomic data. The variability in alleles at those sites can be translated into prediction probabilities that a particular pathogen isolate is adapted to a given host. We illustrate the power of these methods by: 1) identifying the sites explaining SARS coronavirus differences between human, bat and palm civet samples; 2) showing how cross species jumps of rabies virus among bat populations can be readily identified; and 3) de novo identification of likely functional influenza host discriminant markers. © 2013 Aguas and Ferguson.",,"allele; article; bat; civet (animal); Coronavirus; genetic variability; heredity;

The construction of the feature vector is based on the contents of amino acids, total distance of each amino acid from the first amino acid in the protein sequence and the distribution of 20 amino acids. The obtained cosine distance metric (also called the similarity matrix) is used to construct the phylogenetic tree by the neighbour joining method. In order to show the applicability of our approach, we tested it on three proteins: 1) ND5 protein sequences from nine species, 2) ND6 protein sequences from eight species, and 3) 50 coronavirus spike proteins. The results are in agreement with known history and the output from the multiple sequence alignment program ClustalW, which is widely used. We have also compared our phylogenetic results with six other recently proposed alignment-free methods. These comparisons show that our proposed method gives a more consistent biological relationship than the others. In addition, the time complexity is linear and space required is less as compared with other alignment-free methods that use graphical representation. It should be noted that the multiple sequence alignment method has exponential time complexity. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","alignment-free method; cosine distance metric; phylogenetic tree; sequence similarity analysis","amino acid; protein; algorithm; article; chemistry; evaluation study; methodology; molecular biology; phylogeny; sequence homology; Algorithms; Amino Acids; Molecular Biology; Phylogeny; Proteins; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Coronavirus",,"amino acid, 65072-01-7; protein, 67254-75-5; Amino Acids; Proteins",,,,,,,,"Chou, K.-C., Shen, H.-B., Recent progress in protein subcellular location prediction (2007) Anal.

In order to improve accuracy of prediction, we designed a novel approach, using epitope prediction methods in combination with molecular docking techniques, to identify MHC class I restricted T-cell epitopes. Analysis of the HIV-1 p24 protein and influenza virus matrix protein revealed that the present approach is effective, yielding prediction accuracy of over 80% with respect to experimental data. Subsequently, we applied such a method for prediction of T-cell epitopes in SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) S, N and M proteins. Based on available experimental data, the prediction accuracy is up to 90% for S protein. We suggest the use of epitope prediction methods in combination with 3D structural modelling of peptide-MHC-TCR complex to identify MHC class I restricted T-cell epitopes for use in epitope based vaccines like HIV and human cancers, which should provide a valuable step forward for the design of better vaccines and may provide in depth understanding about activation of T-cell epitopes by MHC binding peptides. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It is assumed that the virus causing FIP develops via an in-vivo mutation from the feline enteric coronavirus. Thus, direct transmission of FIP virus from cat to cat can be excluded. During the past few years, the prevalence of FIP has been increasing, affecting mostly young animals. The clinical signs are numerous and non-specific as are the routine laboratory findings. Unfortunately, neither direct nor indirect detection of the virus can differentiate between the enteric corona virus, causing mild enteritis, and the deadly mutated corona virus causing FIP. A presumptive diagnosis of FIP is common; however, without the typical effusions it is difficult to confirm. Using an algorithm based on clinical findings, routine laboratory and molecular test results is the best way to reach a definite diagnosis. The Rivalta test, often cited as having excellent sensitivity, seems to be associated with many false negative results and therefore cannot be recommended as a routine screening test. However, RT-PCR from pleural or peritoneal fluid has shown to be 98% accurate for diagnosing the effusive form of FIP and is most likely the best initial test. Reliable prophylaxis and curative therapy are unknown so far and prognosis is still forlorn.","Ascites; Felids; Infectious diseases; Rivalta test; Virus infection",,,,,,,,,,,"Addie, D., Toth, S., Murray, G., Jarrett, O., The risk of typical and antibody enhanced feline infectious peritonitis among cats from feline coronavirus endemic households (1995) Feline Pract, 23, pp. 24-32; Addie, D.D., Toth, S., Herrewegh, A.A.P.M., Jarrett, O., Feline coronavirus in the intestinal contents of cats with feline infectious peritonitis (1996) Veterinary Record, 139 (21), pp. 522-523; Addie, D., Dennis, J., Toth, S., Callanan, J., Reid, S., Jarrett, O., Long-term impact on a closed household of pet cats of natural infection with feline coronavirus, feline leukaemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus (2000) Vet Rec, 146, pp. 419-424; Addie, D.D., Paltrinieri, S., Pedersen, N.C., Recommendations from workshops of the second international feline coronavirus/feline infectious peritonitis symposium (2004) Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery, 6 (2), pp. 125-130. , DOI 10.1016/j.jfms.2003.12.009; Addie, D., Belak, S., Boucraut-Baralon, C., Egberink, H., Frymus, T., Gruffydd-Jones, T., Hartmann, K., Horzinek, M., Feline infectious peritonitis.

Markham St. Slot 781, Little Rock, AR 72205, United States","Background: To estimate a classifier's error in predicting future observations, bootstrap methods have been proposed as reduced-variation alternatives to traditional cross-validation (CV) methods based on sampling without replacement. Monte Carlo (MC) simulation studies aimed at estimating the true misclassification error conditional on the training set are commonly used to compare CV methods. We conducted an MC simulation study to compare a new method of bootstrap CV (BCV) to k-fold CV for estimating clasification error. Findings. For the low-dimensional conditions simulated, the modest positive bias of k-fold CV contrasted sharply with the substantial negative bias of the new BCV method. This behavior was corroborated using a real-world dataset of prognostic gene-expression profiles in breast cancer patients. Our simulation results demonstrate some extreme characteristics of variance and bias that can occur due to a fault in the design of CV exercises aimed at estimating the true conditional error of a classifier, and that appear not to have been fully appreciated in previous studies. Although CV is a sound practice for estimating a classifier's generalization error, using CV to estimate the fixed misclassification error of a trained classifier conditional on the training set is problematic. While MC simulation of this estimation exercise can correctly represent the average bias of a classifier, it will overstate the between-run variance of the bias. Conclusions: We recommend k-fold CV over the new BCV method for estimating a classifier's generalization error. The extreme negative bias of BCV is too high a price to pay for its reduced variance. © 2012 Ounpraseuth et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Bootstrap Cross-validation; Classification Error Estimation; Cross-validation; Mean Squared Error","Bovine coronavirus; algorithm; article; breast tumor; computer simulation; DNA microarray; female; gene expression; gene expression profiling; genetics; human; methodology; Monte Carlo method; predictive value; prognosis; Algorithms; Breast Neoplasms; Computer Simulation; Female; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Monte Carlo Method; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Research Design",,,,,,,,,,"Moon, H., Ahn, H., Kodell, R.L., Baek, S., Lin, C.-J., Chen, J.J., Ensemble methods for classification of patients for personalized medicine with high-dimensional data (2007) Artif Intell Med, 41, pp. 197-207. , 10.1016/j.artmed.2007.07.003 17719213; Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., Friedman, J., (2001) The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference and Prediction, , Springer, New York; Ambroise, C., McLachlan, G.J., Selection bias in gene extraction on the basis of microarray gene-expression data (2002) Proc Natl Acad Sci, 99, pp. 6562-6566. , 10.1073/pnas.102102699 11983868; Subramanian, J., Simon, R., An evaluation of resampling methods for assessment of survival risk prediction in high-dimensional settings (2011) Stat Med, 30, pp. 642-653. , 10.1002/sim.4106 21337359; Liu, Y., Yao, X., Higuchi, T., Evolutionary ensembles with negative correlation learning (2000) IEEE Trans Evol Comput, 4, pp. 380-387. , 10.1109/4235.887237; Arena, V.C., Sussman, N.B., Mazumdar, S., Yu, S., MacIna, O.T., The utility of structure-activity relationship (SAR) models for prediction and covariate selection in developmental toxicity: Comparative analysis of logistic regression and decision tree models (2004) SAR QSAR Environ Res, 15, pp. 1-18. , 10.1080/1062936032000169633 15113065; Molinaro, A.M., Simon, R., Pfeiffer, R.M., Prediction error estimation: A comparison of resampling methods (2005) Bioinformatics, 21, pp. 3301-3307. , 10.1093/bioinformatics/bti499 15905277; Efron, B., Estimating the error rate of a prediction rule: Improvement on cross-validation (1983) J Amer Stat Assoc, 78, pp. 316-331. , 10.1080/01621459.1983.10477973; Efron, B., Tibshirani, R., Improvements on cross-validation: The.632+ Bootstrap method (1997) J Amer Stat Assoc, 92, pp. 548-560; Fu, W.J., Carroll, R.J., Wang, S., Estimating misclassification error with small samples via bootstrap cross-validation (2005) Bioinformatics, 21, pp. 1979-1986. , 10.1093/bioinformatics/bti294 15691862; Kim, J.-H., Estimating classification error rate: Repeated cross-validation, repeated hold-out and bootstrap (2009) Comput Stat Data Anal, 53, pp. 3735-3745. , 10.1016/j.csda.2009.04.009; Friedman, J., Regularized discriminant analysis (1989) J Amer Stat Assoc, 84, pp. 165-175. , 10.1080/01621459.1989.10478752; (2007) R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing, , R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria http://www.R-project.org, accessed November 2, 2007; (2004) SAS/IML 9.1 User's Guide, , SAS SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina; Davison, A.C., Hall, P., On the bias and variability of bootstrap and cross-validation estimates of error rate in discrimination problems (1992) Biometrika, 79 (2), pp. 279-284. , 10.1093/biomet/79.2.279; Efron, B., Tibshirani, R., (1993) An Introduction to the Bootstrap, , Chapman & Hall/CRC, Boca Raton, Florida; Van'T Veer, L.J., Dai, H., Van De Vijver, M.J., He, Y.D., Hart, A.A., Mao, M., Gene expression profiling predicts clinical outcome of breast cancer (2002) Nature, 415, pp. 530-536. , 10.1038/415530a 11823860; Van De Vijver, M.J., He, Y.D., A gene-expression signature as a predictor of survival in breast cancer (2002) N Engl J Med, 347, pp. 1999-2009. , 10.1056/NEJMoa021967 12490681; Nguyen, V.D., Rocke, M.D., Tumor classification by partial least squares using microarray gene expression data (2002) Bioinformatics, 18, pp. 39-50. , 10.1093/bioinformatics/18.1.39 11836210","Ounpraseuth, S.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, 4301 W.

This report describes a virus identification method featuring high throughput, high resolution, and high sensitivity detection of viruses. Identification of virus is based on liquid hybridization of different lengths of virus-specific probes to their corresponding viruses. The probes bound to target sequences are removed by a biotin-streptavidin pull-down mechanism and the supernatant is analyzed by capillary electrophoresis. The probes depleted from the sample appear as diminished peaks in the electropherograms and the remaining probes serve as calibrators to align peaks in different capillaries. The virus identities are unraveled by a signal processing and peak detection algorithm developed in-house. Nine viruses were used in the study to demonstrate how the system works to unravel the virus identity in single and double virus infections. With properly designed probes, the system is able to distinguish closely related viruses. The system takes advantage of the high resolution feature of capillary electrophoresis to resolve probes that differ by length. The method may facilitate virus identity screen from more candidate viruses with an automated 4-color DNA sequencer. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..","Capillary electrophoresis; Liquid hybridization; Signal processing; Virus identification","Biotin-streptavidin; Clinical samples; Electropherograms; High resolution; High throughput; High-sensitivity detection; Peak detection; Target sequences; Viral infections; Virus identification; Virus infection; Capillary electrophoresis; Liquids; Probes; Proteins; Signal processing; Viruses; biotin; streptavidin; algorithm; article; calibrator; capillary electrophoresis; Dengue virus 1; Dengue virus 2; Dengue virus 3; Dengue virus 4; DNA sequence; electrophoresis; high throughput screening; Human adenovirus; hybridization; Influenza virus A; Japanese encephalitis virus; molecular probe; nonhuman; pandemic; priority journal; SARS coronavirus; signal processing; supernatant; Transmissible gastroenteritis virus; virus detection; virus identification; virus infection; DNA Probes; Electrophoresis, Capillary; Humans; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sensitivity and Specificity; Time Factors; Virus Diseases; Viruses",,"biotin, 58-85-5; streptavidin, 9013-20-1; DNA Probes",,,"National Science Council, NSC: NSC 92-2751-B-001-018-Y

Presently, more than 15 peptide-based drugs are in various stages of clinical trials. Emerging and re-emerging viruses further emphasize the efforts to accelerate antiviral drug discovery efforts. Despite, huge importance of the field, no dedicated AVP resource is available. In the present study, we have collected 1245 peptides which were experimentally checked for antiviral activity targeting important human viruses like influenza, HIV, HCV and SARS, etc. After removing redundant peptides, 1056 peptides were divided into 951 training and 105 validation data sets. We have exploited various peptides sequence features, i.e. motifs and alignment followed by amino acid composition and physicochemical properties during 5-fold cross validation using Support Vector Machine. Physiochemical properties-based model achieved maximum 85 accuracy and 0.70 Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Performance of this model on the experimental validation data set showed 86 accuracy and 0.71 MCC which is far better than the general antimicrobial peptides prediction methods. Therefore, AVPpred-the first web server for predicting the highly effective AVPs would certainly be helpful to researchers working on peptide-based antiviral development.

Samples collected from 69 pups dead as a consequence of acute, systemic disease were analysed and 7 dogs tested positive for CCoV in their internal organs. Six CCoV strains were characterised as CCoV-lla (potentially pantropic CCoVs), whereas the remaining strain was subtyped as CCoV-llb (recombinant strains with swine coronavirus). Viral RNA distribution in internal organs was variable, with titres generally low, and no pantropic strain was isolated on cell cultures. Sequence analysis of the 5' end of the spike protein gene showed the absence of specific genetic markers and the existence of high genetic and phylogenetic relatedness of the strains detected in the survey and prototype Italian and Greek viruses. The results of this survey demonstrate that pantropic CCoV is circulating in Italy, so that the virus should be enclosed in the diagnostic algorithm of the acute, systemic infectious diseases of the dog.","Dog; Epidemiological surveillance; Pantropic coronavirus","Canine coronavirus; Canis familiaris; Coronavirus; Suidae",,,,,,,,,,"Enjuanes, L., Brian, D., Cavanagh, D., Coronaviridae (2000) Virus Taxonomy, Classification and Nomenclature of Viruses, pp. 835-849. , Eds.

The various prediction algorithms are being used to capture the MHC peptide binding preference, allowing the rapid scan of entire pathogen proteomes for peptide likely to bind MHC, saving the cost, effort, and time. However, the number of known binders/non-binders (BNB) to a specific MHC molecule is limited in many cases, which still poses a computational challenge for prediction. The training data should be adequate to predict BNB using any machine learning approach. In this study, variable learning rate has been demonstrated for training artificial neural network and predicting BNB for small datasets. The approach can be used for large datasets as well. The dataset for different MHC class I alleles for SARS Corona virus (Tor2 Replicase polyprotein 1ab) has been used for training and prediction of BNB. A total of 90 datasets (nine different MHC class I alleles with tenfold cross validation) have been retrieved from IEDB database for BNB. For fixed learning rate approach, the best value of AROC is 0.65, and in most of the cases it is 0.5, which shows the poor predictions. In case of variable learning rate, of the 90 datasets the value of AROC for 76 datasets is between 0.806 and 1.0 and for 7 datasets the value is between 0.7 and 0.8 and for rest of 7 datasets it is between 0.5 and 0.7, which indicates very good performance in most of the cases. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Artificial neural network; Epitope prediction; MHC class I binder/non-binder; SARS Corona virus; T-cell immune response; Vaccine designing; Variable learning rate","major histocompatibility antigen class 1; peptide; HLA antigen class 1; allele; artificial neural network; case study; conference paper; controlled study; data base; information retrieval; learning algorithm; nonhuman; prediction; priority journal; SARS coronavirus; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; binding site; biology; evaluation; gene; genetic database; genetics; human; immunology; metabolism; protein binding; proteomics; statistics; validation study; Algorithms; Alleles; Artificial Intelligence; Binding Sites; Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Genes, MHC Class I; Histocompatibility Antigens Class I; Humans; Neural Networks (Computer); Protein Binding; Proteomics; SARS Virus",,"Histocompatibility Antigens Class I",,,,,,,,"Robinson, H.L., Amara, R.R., T cell vaccines for microbial infections (2005) Nature Medicine, 11 (4 SUPPL.), pp. S25-S32. , DOI 10/nm1212; De Groot, A.S., Rappuoli, R., Genome-derived vaccines (2004) Expert Review of Vaccines, 3 (1), pp. 59-76. , DOI 10.1586/14760584.3.1.59; De Groot, A.S., Sbai, H., Aubin, C.S., McMurry, J., Martin, W., Immuno-informatics: Mining genomes for vaccine components (2002) Immunology and Cell Biology, 80 (3), pp. 255-269. , DOI 10.1046/j.1440-1711.2002.01092.x; Rappuoli, R., Reverse vaccinology, a genome-based approach to vaccine development (2001) Vaccine, 19 (17-19), pp. 2688-2691. , DOI 10.1016/S0264-410X(00)00554-5, PII S0264410X00005545; Tamas, G.S., Critical role of glycosylation in determining the length and structure of T-cell epitopes-As suggested by a combined in silico systems biology approach (2009) Immunome Research, 5, p. 4; Holmes, K.V., SARS coronavirus: A new challenge for prevention and therapy (2003) Journal of Clinical Investigation, 111 (11), pp. 1605-1609; Tong, J.C., Methods and protocols for prediction of immuno-genic epitopes (2006) Briefings in Bioinformatics, 8 (2), pp. 96-108; Zhao, B., MHC-binding peptide prediction for epitope based vaccine design (2007) International Journal of Integrative Biology, 1 (2), pp. 127-140; Armano, G., A hybrid genetic-neural system for predicting protein secondary structure (2005) BMC Bioinformatics, 6 (4), pp. S3; Yeon-Jin, C., Prediction rule generation of MHC class i binding peptides using ANN and GA, LICNC 2005 (2005) LNCS, 3610, pp. 1009-1016; Brusic, V., Rudy, G., Honeyman, M., Hammer, J., Harrison, L., Prediction of MHC class II-binding peptides using an evolutionary algorithm and artificial neural network (1998) Bioinformatics, 14 (2), pp. 121-130; Riedesel, H., Peptide binding at class i major histo-compatibility complex scored with linear functions and support vector machines (2004) Genome Informatics, 15 (1), pp. 198-212; Bhasin, M., Raghava, G.P.S., A hybrid approach for predicting promiscuous MHC class I restricted T cell epitopes (2007) Journal of Biosciences, 32 (1), pp. 31-42. , http://www.ias.ac.in/jbiosci/jan2007/31-42.pdf, DOI 10.1007/s12038-007-0004-5; Soam, S.S., Prediction of MHC class i binding peptides using probability distribution functions (2009) Bioinformation, 3 (9), pp. 403-408; Singh, S.P., Evaluation of threading based method for prediction of peptides binding to MHC class i alleles (2008) International Journal of Integrative Biology, 4 (1), pp. 16-20; Singh, S.P., Prediction ofMHC binding peptides using Gibbs motif sampler, weight matrix and artificial neural network (2008) Bioinformation, 3 (4), pp. 150-155; Tollenaere, T., SuperSAB: Fast adaptive back-propagation with good scaling properties (1990) Neural Networks, 3 (5), pp. 561-573; Castillo, E., Guijarro-Berdinas, B., Fontenla-Romero, O., Alonso-Betanzos, A., A very fast learning method for neural networks based on sensitivity analysis (2006) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 7, pp. 1159-1182. , http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume7/castillo06a/castillo06a.pdf","Mishra, B.N.; Department of Biotechnology, Institute of Engineering and Technology, UP Technical University, Lucknow, India; email: profbnmishra@gmail.com","Arabnia H.R.Tran Q.N.",,,,,,,00652598,9781441970459,AEMBA,"21431562","English","Adv.

Most of the time the pathogens stay unkown and the current recommendations for the treatment of pneumonia are mainly based on a severity score to adapt the treatement to the risk. Nonethless new pathogens have recently been identified, coronavirus for SRASS, H5N1 for avianFlu, N1N1 for pandemicFlu, 35 yearsafter the identification of Legionella pneumophila. These exemples stress the necessity to do and continue to identify pathogens in these clinical situations. Those last years new diagnostic tests have been elaborated: antigen detection in urines or in nasopharyngeal samples, molecular methods allowing to look at one or several pathogens at the same time on a single sample (Multiplex) with an Increased sensitivity with regard to the more classical methods. Indirect methods have been developed to quantify inflammation in correlation with a bacterial or not Infection.

Finally, phylogenic tree is constructed to analyze evolutionary relationships among various species. As the examinations, phylogenic trees of 13 β-globin proteins belonging to different species and 26 coronavirus spike proteins are reconstructed, respectively, and it is observed that our method is very effective. As the algorithm is very simple, this method is time-saving than many previous studies.

This method uses a natural representation of genomic data by binary indicator sequences of each nucleotide (adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T)). Afterwards, the discrete Fourier transform is applied to these indicator sequences to calculate spectra of the nucleotides. Mathematical moments are calculated for each of these spectra to create a multidimensional vector in a Euclidean space for each gene or genome sequence. Thus, each gene or genome sequence is realized as a geometric point in the Euclidean space. Finally, pairwise Euclidean distances between these points (i.e. genome sequences) are calculated to cluster the gene or genome sequences. This method is applied to three sets of data. The first is 34 strains of coronavirus genomic data, the second is 118 of the known strains of Human rhinovirus (HRV), and the third is 30 bacteria genomes. The distance matrices are computed based on the three sets, showing the distances from each point to the others. We used the complete linkage clustering algorithm to build phylogenetic trees to indicate how the distances among these sequence correspond to the evolutionary relationship among these sequences. This genome representation provides a powerful and efficient method to classify genomes and is much faster than the widely acknowledged multiple sequence alignment method. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Clustering; DNA sequences; Fourier spectral method; Moment vectors; Phylogenetic trees","adenine; cytosine; guanine; thymine; algorithm; cluster analysis; efficiency measurement; Fourier transform; genetic analysis; genome; microbial activity; phylogenetics; spectral analysis; virus; article; bacterial genome; classification algorithm; cluster analysis; controlled study; Coronavirus; DNA sequence; genetic distance; genetic linkage; genome analysis; infrared spectroscopy; mathematical model; molecular evolution; molecular phylogeny; phylogenetic tree; power spectrum; priority journal; Rhinovirus; sequence alignment; virus genome; Bacteria; Cluster Analysis; Coronavirus; Fourier Analysis; Genome; Humans; Nucleotides; Phylogeny; Rhinovirus; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Coronavirus; Human rhinovirus sp.",,"adenine, 22177-51-1, 2922-28-3, 73-24-5; cytosine, 71-30-7; guanine, 69257-39-2, 73-40-5; thymine, 65-71-4; Nucleotides",,,,,,,,"Brown, N.P., Larkin, M.A., Blackshields, G., Clustal w and clustal x version 2.0 (2007) Bioinformatics, 23 (21), pp. 2947-2948; Dawyndt, P., De Meyer, H., De Baets, B., The complete linkage clustering algorithm revisited (2005) Soft Computing, 9, pp. 385-392. , May; Edgar, R.C., MUSCLE: multiple sequence alignment with high accuracy and high throughput (2004) Nucleic Acids Research, 32 (5), pp. 1792-1797; Katoh, K., Asimenos, G., Toh, H., Multiple alignment of dna sequences with MAFFT (2009) Methods Molecular Biology, 537, pp. 39-64; Kryukov, K., Saitou, N., MISHIMA - a new method for high speed multiple alignment of nucleotide sequences of bacterial genome scale data (2010) BMC Bioinformatics, 11 (142); Palmenberg, A.C., Spiro, D., Kuzmickas, R., Wang, S., Djikeng, A., Sequencing and analyses of all known human rhinovirus genomes reveal structure and evolution (2009) Science, 324, pp. 55-59; Peebles, P., (2000) Probability, Random Variables, and Random Signal Principles, , McGraw-Hill; (2008), R Development Core Team, R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing.

Here we propose a strategy to reduce model bias when only part of a new structure is known: after the MR search, structure determination of the unknown part of the new structure can be facilitated by cross-crystal averaging of the known part of the new structure with the search model. This strategy dramatically improves electron density in the unknown part of the new structure. It has enabled us to determine the structures of two coronavirus receptor-binding domains each complexed with their receptor at moderate resolutions. In a test case, it also enabled automated model building when >50% of an antigen-antibody complex was absent. These results suggest that this averaging strategy can be routinely used after MR to enhance the interpretability of electron density associated with missing model. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"CD2 antigen; glycoprotein gp 120; antigen antibody complex; article; complex formation; crystal structure; crystallography; macromolecule; molecular replacement; nonhuman; priority journal; protein domain; receptor binding; SARS coronavirus; structure analysis; Algorithms; Antigen-Antibody Complex; Binding Sites; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Crystallization; Crystallography, X-Ray; Electrons; Humans; Models, Molecular; Molecular Conformation; Protein Binding; Receptors, Virus; Coronavirus",,"Antigen-Antibody Complex; Receptors, Virus; coronavirus receptor",,,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI: K99HL097083

We aimed to demonstrate capacity of the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (RT-PCR/ESI-MS) platform to identify clinical relevant respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples and compare the diagnostic performance characteristics relative to conventional culture- and antigen-based methods. An RT-PCR/ESI-MS respiratory virus surveillance kit designed to detect respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1-4, Adenoviridae types A-F, Coronaviridae, human bocavirus, and human metapneumovirus was evaluated using both mock-ups and frozen archived NPA (N = 280), 95 of which were positive by clinical virology methods. RT-PCR/ESI-MS detected 74/95 (77.9%) known positive samples and identified an additional 13/185 (7%) from culture-negative samples. Viruses that are nondetectable with conventional methods were also identified. Viral load was semiquantifiable and ranged from 2400 to >320>000 copies/mL. Time to results was 8 h. RT-PCR/ESI-MS showed promise in rapid detection of respiratory viruses and merits further evaluation for use in clinical settings. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Diagnosis; Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; Respiratory tract infections; Surveillance; Viruses","Adenovirus; article; Bocavirus; controlled study; Coronavirus; diagnostic test accuracy study; electrospray mass spectrometry; human; Human metapneumovirus; immunological procedures; Influenza virus A; Influenza virus B; intermethod comparison; nasopharyngeal aspiration; nonhuman; Parainfluenza virus; priority journal; Respiratory syncytial pneumovirus; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; viral upper respiratory tract infection; virus culture; virus identification; virus load; Acute Disease; Adenoviridae; Algorithms; Humans; Influenza A virus; Influenza B virus; Parainfluenza Virus 2, Human; Parainfluenza Virus 3, Human; Reagent Kits, Diagnostic; Reproducibility of Results; Respiratory Syncytial Viruses; Respiratory Tract Infections; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; SARS Virus; Sensitivity and Specificity; Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization",,"Reagent Kits, Diagnostic",,,,,,,,"Anzueto, A., Niederman, M.S., Diagnosis and treatment of rhinovirus respiratory infections (2003) Chest, 123, pp. 1664-1672; Bryce, J., Boschi-Pinto, C., Shibuya, K., Black, R.E., WHO estimates of the causes of death in children (2005) Lancet, 365, pp. 1147-1152; Doring, G., Unertl, K., Heininger, A., Validation criteria for nucleic acid amplification techniques for bacterial infections (2008) Clin Chem Lab Med, 46, pp. 909-918; Ecker, D.J., Sampath, R., Blyn, L.B., Eshoo, M.W., Ivy, C., Ecker, J.A., Libby, B., Hofstadler, S.A., Rapid identification and strain-typing of respiratory pathogens for epidemic surveillance (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 102, pp. 8012-8017; Ecker, J.A., Massire, C., Hall, T.A., Ranken, R., Pennella, T.T., Agasino Ivy, C., Blyn, L.B., Eshoo, M.W., Identification of Acinetobacter species and genotyping of Acinetobacter baumannii by multilocus PCR and mass spectrometry (2006) J Clin Microbiol, 44, pp. 2921-2932; Frisbie, B., Tang, Y.W., Griffin, M., Poehling, K., Wright, P.F., Holland, K., Edwards, K.M., Surveillance of childhood influenza virus infection: what is the best diagnostic method to use for archival samples?

Molecular diagnostic tests have greatly increased our understanding of the role of viruses in pneumonia, and findings indicate that the incidence of viral pneumonia has been underestimated. In children, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and parainfluenza viruses are the agents identified most frequently in both developed and developing countries. Dual viral infections are common, and a third of children have evidence of viral-bacterial co-infection. In adults, viruses are the putative causative agents in a third of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, in particular influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses. Bacteria continue to have a predominant role in adults with pneumonia. Presence of viral epidemics in the community, patient's age, speed of onset of illness, symptoms, biomarkers, radiographic changes, and response to treatment can help differentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia. However, no clinical algorithm exists that will distinguish clearly the cause of pneumonia. No clear consensus has been reached about whether patients with obvious viral community-acquired pneumonia need to be treated with antibiotics. Apart from neuraminidase inhibitors for pneumonia caused by influenza viruses, there is no clear role for use of specific antivirals to treat viral community-acquired pneumonia. Influenza vaccines are the only available specific preventive measures. Further studies are needed to better understand the cause and pathogenesis of community-acquired pneumonia. Furthermore, regional differences in cause of pneumonia should be investigated, in particular to obtain more data from developing countries. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"aciclovir; alpha interferon; amantadine; cidofovir; influenza vaccine; oseltamivir; palivizumab; peramivir; pleconaril; ribavirin; rimantadine; zanamivir; 2009 H1N1 influenza; article; avian influenza; Bocavirus; child; community acquired pneumonia; Coronavirus; human; Human metapneumovirus; immunocompromised patient; influenza A; influenza B; Influenza virus; mixed infection; molecular diagnosis; Parainfluenza virus; pathogenesis; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; Respiratory syncytial pneumovirus; Rhinovirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; virus pneumonia",,"aciclovir, 59277-89-3; amantadine, 665-66-7, 768-94-5; cidofovir, 113852-37-2; oseltamivir, 196618-13-0, 204255-09-4, 204255-11-8; palivizumab, 188039-54-5; peramivir, 229614-55-5, 229614-56-6, 229615-12-7; pleconaril, 153168-05-9; ribavirin, 36791-04-5; rimantadine, 13392-28-4, 1501-84-4; zanamivir, 139110-80-8",,,,,,,,"BTS guidelines for the management of community acquired pneumonia in childhood (2002) Thorax, 57 (SUPPL. 1), pp. 1-24. , British Thoracic Society of Standards of Care Committee; McIntosh, K., Community-acquired pneumonia in children (2002) N Engl J Med, 346, pp. 429-437; File, T.M., Community-acquired pneumonia (2003) Lancet, 362, pp. 1991-2001; Durrington, H.J., Summers, C., Recent changes in the management of community acquired pneumonia in adults (2008) BMJ, 336 (7658), pp. 1429-1433. , DOI 10.1136/bmj.a285; Lim, W.S., Baudoin, S.V., George, R.C., British Thoracic Society guidelines for the management of community acquired pneumonia in adults: Update 2009 (2009) Thorax, 64 (SUPPL.

Polymerase chain reaction-based methods are becoming more standardized, and several have undergone the scrutiny of regulatory agencies mandated to assess the risks and benefits of implementing pathogen-detection assays into diagnostic algorithms. Respiratory viruses lead to both upper and lower RTI and are implicated in exacerbations of chronic pulmonary conditions. Viruses from different taxonomic families present with overlapping clinical signs and symptoms, necessitating an accurate laboratory diagnosis. The clinical utility of diagnostic algorithms incorporating tests for respiratory viruses will depend on the breadth of pathogen coverage and the time to reliable and actionable results. This review covers strategies for detecting a panel of respiratory viruses employed over the last decade that have enabled an etiological diagnosis of RTI in a cost-effective manner. © 2011 New York Academy of Sciences.","Diagnosis; Laboratory; Multiplex; Nucleic acid; PCR; Respiratory virus","Adenovirus; algorithm; article; Coronavirus; cost effectiveness analysis; diagnostic kit; diagnostic test accuracy study; Enterovirus; human; Human metapneumovirus; Influenza virus A; Influenza virus A H1N1; Influenza virus A H3N2; Influenza virus A H5N1; Influenza virus B; nucleic acid amplification; Parainfluenza virus 1; Parainfluenza virus 2; Parainfluenza virus 3; Parainfluenza virus 4; polymerase chain reaction; quantitative analysis; Respiratory syncytial pneumovirus; respiratory tract infection; Rhinovirus; sensitivity and specificity; virus detection",,,"xMAP, Luminex; xTAG, Luminex","Luminex",,,,,,"Beck, E.T., Henrickson, K.J., Molecular diagnosis of respiratory viruses (2010) Future Microbiol., 5, pp. 901-916. , Review; Mahony, J.B., Detection of respiratory viruses by molecular methods (2008) Clin.

This paper introduces a new hierarchical clustering problem defined by a novel objective function we call the arithmeticharmonic cut. We show that the problem of finding such a cut is NP-hard and APX-hard but is fixed-parameter tractable, which indicates that although the problem is unlikely to have a polynomial time algorithm (even for approximation), exact parameterized and local search based techniques may produce workable algorithms. To this end, we implement a memetic algorithm for the problem and demonstrate the effectiveness of the arithmetic-harmonic cut on a number of datasets including a cancer type dataset and a corona virus dataset. We show favorable performance compared to currently used hierarchical clustering techniques such as k-MEANS, Graclus and NORMALIZED-CUT. The arithmetic-harmonic cut metric overcoming difficulties other hierarchal methods have in representing both intercluster differences and intracluster similarities. © 2010 Rizzi et al.",,"arithmetic; article; cancer classification; classification algorithm; cluster analysis; controlled study; Coronavirus; human; intermethod comparison; mathematical analysis; nonhuman; algorithm; biology; cluster analysis; colon tumor; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; leukemia; melanoma; metabolism; methodology; statistical model; theoretical model; tumor cell line; Coronavirus; Algorithms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cluster Analysis; Colonic Neoplasms; Computational Biology; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Leukemia; Melanoma; Models, Statistical; Models, Theoretical",,,,,,,,,,"Shi, J., Malik, J., Normalized cuts and image segmentation (2000) IEEE Transactions of Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 22, pp. 888-905; Wertheimer, M., Laws of organization in perceptual forms (partial translation) (1938) A Sourcebook of Gestalt Psychology, pp. 71-88; Papadimitriou, C.H., Yannakakis, M., Optimization, approximation, and complexity classes (1991) Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 43, pp. 425-440; de Hoon, M.J., Imoto, S., Nolan, J., Miyano, S., Open source clustering software (2004) Bioinformatics, 20, pp. 1453-1454; Wu, Z., Leahy, R., An optimal graph theoretic approach to data clustering: Theory and its application to image segmentation (1993) IEEE Transactions of Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 15, pp. 1101-1113; Wang, S., Siskind, J.F., Image segmentation with ratio cut (2003) IEEE Transactions of Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 25, pp. 675-690; Wei, Y.C., Cheng, C.K., Ratio cut partitioning for hierarchical designs (1991) IEEE Transactions On Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, 10, pp. 911-921; Yu, S.X., Shi, J., (2003) Multiclass Spectral Clustering, , In: International Conference on Computer Vision; Dhillon, I.S., Guan, Y., Kulis, B., Weighted graph cuts without eigenvectors: A multilevel approach (2007) IEEE Transactions of Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 29, pp. 1944-1957; Mahata, P., Costa, W., Cotta, C., Moscato, P., (2006) Hierarchical Clustering, Languages and Cancer, pp. 67-78. , EvoWorkshops 2006; Ausiello, G., Crescenzi, P., Gambosi, G., Kann, V., Spaccamela, A.M., (1999) Complexity and Approximation: Combinatorial Optimization Problems and Their Approximability Properties, , New York: Springer-Verlag; Flum, J., Grohe, M., (2006) Parameterized Complexity Theory, , New York: Springer; Karp, R.M., (1972) Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems.

Here, a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid (N) protein-derived CTL epitope, N1 (QFKDNVILL), restricted by HLA-A*2402 was identified by a series of in vitro studies, including a computer-assisted algorithm for prediction, stabilization of the peptide by co-refolding with HLA-A*2402 heavy chain and β2-microglobulin (β2m), and T2-A24 cell binding. Consequently, the antigenicity of the peptide was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT), proliferation assays, and HLA-peptide complex tetramer staining using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from donors who had recovered from SARS donors. Furthermore, the crystal structure of HLA-A*2402 complexed with peptide N1 was determined, and the featured peptide was characterized with two unexpected intrachain hydrogen bonds which augment the central residues to bulge out of the binding groove. This may contribute to the T-cell receptor (TCR) interaction, showing a host immunodominant peptide presentation strategy. Meanwhile, a rapid and efficient strategy is presented for the determination of naturally presented CTL epitopes in the context of given HLA alleles of interest from long immunogenic overlapping peptides.

NAB is a 116-residue α/β protein, which contains 9 prolines and has 50% of its residues located in loops and turns. Overall, the results presented here show that sizeable nearest-neighbor effects are seen only for residues preceding proline, where Pro introduces an overestimation, on average, of 1.73 ppm in the computed 13Cα chemical shifts. A new ensemble of 20 conformers representing the NMR structure of the NAB, which was calculated with an input containing backbone torsion angle constraints derived from the theoretical 13Cα chemical shifts as supplementary data to the NOE distance constraints, exhibits very similar topology and comparable agreement with the NOE constraints as the published NMR structure. However, the two structures differ in the patterns of differences between observed and computed 13Cα chemical shifts, Δ ca,i, for the individual residues along the sequence. This indicates that the Δ ca,i -values for the NAB protein are primarily a consequence of the limited sampling by the bundles of 20 conformers used, as in common practice, to represent the two NMR structures, rather than of local flaws in the structures. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","NMR structures of proteins; Quantum-chemical calculation of 13Cα- chemical shifts; Sampling of conformation space","nucleic acid binding protein; proline; article; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; Coronavirus; k nearest neighbor; nonhuman; nuclear Overhauser effect; priority journal; protein structure; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; quantum chemistry; structure activity relation; Algorithms; Carbon Isotopes; Models, Molecular; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular; Protein Conformation; Reproducibility of Results; SARS Virus; Viral Proteins; SARS coronavirus",,"proline, 147-85-3, 7005-20-1; Carbon Isotopes; Viral Proteins",,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: MCB05-41633

In contrast, non-structural proteins encoded by two-thirds of viral genome are poorly characterized for cell-mediated immunity. We previously demonstrated that nucleocapsid-derived peptides chemically coupled to the surface of liposomes effectively elicited SARS-CoV-specific CTLs in mice. Here, we attempted to identify HLA-A*0201-restricted CTL epitopes derived from a non-structural polyprotein 1a (pp1a) of SARS-CoV, and investigated whether liposomal peptides derived from pp1a were effective for CTL induction. Out of 30 peptides predicted on computational algorithms, nine peptides could significantly induce interferon gamma (IFN-γ)-producing CD8+ T cells in mice. These peptides were coupled to the surface of liposomes, and inoculated into mice. Six liposomal peptides effectively induced IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T cells and seven liposomal peptides including the six peptides primed CTLs showing in vivo killing activities. Further, CTLs induced by the seven liposomal peptides lysed an HLA-A*0201 positive cell line expressing naturally processed, pp1a-derived peptides. Of note, one of the liposomal peptides induced high numbers of long-lasting memory CTLs. These data suggest that surface-linked liposomal peptides derived from pp1a might offer an efficient CTL-based vaccine against SARS. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Although many methods have been proposed for protein structure alignment or comparison, alternative similarity measures are still strongly demanded due to the requirement of fast screening and query in large-scale structure databases. In this paper, we first formulate a novel representation of a protein structure, i.e., Feature Sequence of Surface (FSS). Then, a new score scheme is developed to measure the similarity between two representations. To verify the proposed method, numerical experiments are conducted in four different protein data sets. We also classify SARS coronavirus to verify the effectiveness of the new method. Furthermore, preliminary results of fast classification of the whole CATH v2.5.1 database based on the new macrostructure similarity are given as a pilot study. We demonstrate that the proposed approach to measure the similarities between protein structures is simple to implement, computationally efficient, and surprisingly fast. In addition, the method itself provides a new and quantitative tool to view a protein structure. © 2009 IEEE.","Protein structure; Protein surface; Structure comparison","Coarse structure; Computationally efficient; Fast classification; Fast screening; Feature sequence; Large-scale structure; Macrostructures; Numerical experiments; Pilot studies; Protein data; Protein functions; Protein structure alignment; Protein structures; Protein surface; Quantitative tool; SARS coronavirus; Similarity measure; Surface structure; Proteins; SARS coronavirus; protein; algorithm; article; automated pattern recognition; biology; chemical structure; chemistry; computer program; computer simulation; human; metabolism; methodology; protein conformation; protein database; SARS coronavirus; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; Algorithms; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Databases, Protein; Humans; Models, Molecular; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Protein Conformation; Proteins; SARS Virus; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, Protein; Software",,"protein, 67254-75-5; Proteins",,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 60873205, 10631070, 10801131","This work is partly supported by Grant 5039052006CB from the Ministry of Science and Technology, China, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 10801131, 10631070, and 60873205.

A powerful experimental method to gain insights on the physical chemical nature of conformational epitopes is the selection of linear peptides that bind with high affinities to a monoclonal antibody of interest by phage display technology. However, the structural characterization of conformational epitopes from these mimotopes is not straightforward, and in the past the interpretation of peptide sequences from phage display experiments focused on linear sequence analysis to find a consensus sequence or common sequence motifs. Results: We present a fully automated search method, EpiSearch that predicts the possible location of conformational epitopes on the surface of an antigen. The algorithm uses peptide sequences from phage display experiments as input, and ranks all surface exposed patches according to the frequency distribution of similar residues in the peptides and in the patch. We have tested the performance of the EpiSearch algorithm for six experimental data sets of phage display experiments, the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2/neu), the antibody mAb Bo2C11 targeting the C2 domain of FVIII, antibodies mAb 17b and mAb b12 of the HIV envelope protein gp120, mAb 13b5 targeting HIV-1 capsid protein and 80R of the SARS coronavirus spike protein. In all these examples the conformational epitopes as determined by the X-ray crystal structures of the antibody-antigen complexes, were found within the highest scoring patches of EpiSearch, covering in most cases more than 50% residues of experimental observed conformational epitopes. Input options of the program include mapping of a single peptide or a set of peptides on the antigen structure, and the results of the calculation can be visualized on our interactive web server. © The Authors, Licensee Libertas Academica Ltd.","Conformational epitopes; Peptides; Phage display","epitope; algorithm; amino acid sequence; antigen antibody complex; antigen structure; article; autoanalysis; automation; calculation; computer prediction; computer program; controlled study; Coronavirus; crystal structure; nonhuman; phage display; protein conformation; web browser; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Miridae; SARS coronavirus",,,"EpiSearch",,,,,,,"Mirza, O., Henriksen, A., Ipsen, H., Dominant Epitopes and Allergic Cross-Reactivity: Complex Formation Between a Fab Fragment of a Monoclonal Murine IgG Antibody and the Major Allergen from Birch Pollen Bet v 1 (2000) J Immunol, 165, pp. 331-338; Padavattan, S., Schirmer, T., Schmidt, M., Identification of a B-cell Epitope of Hyaluronidase, a Major Bee Venom Allergen, from its Crystal Structure in Complex with a Specific Fab (2007) Journal of Molecular Biology, 368, pp. 742-752; Padlan, E.A., X-ray crystallography of antibodies (1996) Adv Protein Chem, 49, pp. 57-133; Spangfort, M.D., Mirza, O., Ipsen, H., van Neerven, R.J.J., Gajhede, M., Larsen, J.N., Dominating IgE-Binding Epitope of Bet v 1, the Major Allergen of Birch Pollen, Characterized by X-ray Crystallography and Site-Directed Mutagenesis (2003) J Immunol, 171, pp. 3084-3090; Li, Y., Li, H., Yang, F., Smith-Gill, S.J., Mariuzza, R.A., X-ray snapshots of the maturation of an antibody response to a protein antigen (2003) Nat Struct Mol Biol, 10, pp. 482-488; Sidhu, S.S., Fairbrother, W.J., Deshayes, K., Exploring protein-protein interactions with phage display (2003) Chembiochem, 4, pp. 14-25; Diaz, J., Howard, B., Neubauer, M., Olszewski, A., Weiss, G., Exploring biochemistry and cellular biology with protein libraries (2003) Curr Issues Mol Biol, 5, pp. 129-145; Sidhu, S.S., Lowman, H.B., Cunningham, B.C., Wells, J.A., Phage Display for Selection of Novel Binding Peptides (2000) Methods Enzymol, 328, pp. 333-363; Moreau, V., Granier, C., Villard, S., Laune, D., Molina, F., Discontinuous epitope prediction based on mimotope analysis (2006) Bioinformatics, 22, pp. 1088-1095; Smothers, J.F., Henikoff, S., Carter, P., Tech.Sight.

This study attempted to quantify the effect of such changes on the risk of infection in different settings, i.e., the community and hospitals. The 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Hong Kong, where 27% of cases were healthcare workers, was used as an example. A stochastic compartmental SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) model was used: the population was split into healthcare workers, hospitalized people and general population. Super spreading events (SSEs) were taken into account in the model. The temporal evolutions of the daily effective contact rates in the community and hospitals were modeled with smooth functions. Data augmentation techniques and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods were applied to estimate SARS epidemiological parameters. In particular, estimates of daily reproduction numbers were provided for each subpopulation. The average duration of the SARS infectious period was estimated to be 9.3 days (±0.3 days). The model was able to disentangle the impact of the two SSEs from background transmission rates. The effective contact rates, which were estimated on a daily basis, decreased with time, reaching zero inside hospitals. This observation suggests that public health measures and possible changes in individual behaviors effectively reduced transmission, especially in hospitals. The temporal patterns of reproduction numbers were similar for healthcare workers and the general population, indicating that on average, an infectious healthcare worker did not infect more people than any other infectious person. We provide a general method to estimate time dependence of parameters in structured epidemic models, which enables investigation of the impact of control measures and behavioral changes in different settings. © 2009 Cori et al.",,"article;

One case-control study has reported an association between susceptibility to SARS and mannan-binding lectin (MBL) in China. As the downstream protein of MBL, variants of the MBL-associated serine protease-2 (MASP2) gene may be associated with SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection in the same population. Methods: Thirty individuals with SARS were chosen for analysis of MASP2 polymorphisms by means of PCR direct sequencing. Tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) were chosen using pairwise tagging algorithms. The frequencies of four tag SNPs (rs12711521, rs2261695, rs2273346 and rs7548659) were ascertained in 376 SARS patients and 523 control subjects, using the Beckman SNPstream Ultra High Throughput genotyping platform. Results: There is no significant association between alleles or genotypes of the MASP2 tagSNP and susceptibility to SARS-CoV in both Beijing and Guangzhou populations. Diplotype (rs2273346 and rs12711521)were analyzed for association with susceptibility to SARS, no statistically significant evidence of association was observed. The Beijing and Guangzhou sample groups were homogeneous regarding demographic and genetic parameters, a joined analysis also showed no statistically significant evidence of association. Conclusion: Our data do not suggest a role for MASP2 polymorphisms in SARS susceptibility in northern and southern China. © 2009 Wang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"mannan binding lectin associated serine proteinase;

The transition temperature of the RBD in a mixing buffer, composed of glycine, sodium acetate, and sodium phosphate with 100 mM sodium chloride, at pH 6.8, determined by differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism, is 48.74°C. Experimental results showed that the thermal-induced unfolding-folding transition of the RBD follows a two-state model with a reversibility >90%. Using a simple Gō-like model and Langevin dynamics we have shown that, in agreement with our experiments, the folding of the RBD is two-state. Theoretical estimates of thermodynamic quantities are in reasonable agreement with the experiments. Folding and thermal unfolding pathways of the RBD also were experimentally and numerically studied in detail. It was shown that the strand β1 from the N-terminal folds last and unfolds first, while the remaining β-strands fold/unfold cooperatively. © 2009 by the Biophysical Society.",,"acetic acid; glycine; nucleocapsid protein; sodium chloride; sodium dihydrogen phosphate; nucleocapsid protein; nucleocapsid protein, Coronavirus; RNA; amino terminal sequence; article; beta chain; circular dichroism; controlled study; differential scanning calorimetry; experimental model; mathematical model; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; nucleotide binding site; protein folding; RNA binding; SARS coronavirus; thermodynamics; thermostability; transition temperature; algorithm; chemical model; chemical structure; chemistry; computer simulation; metabolism; nuclear magnetic resonance; protein stability; protein tertiary structure; temperature; SARS coronavirus; Algorithms; Calorimetry, Differential Scanning; Circular Dichroism; Computer Simulation; Models, Chemical; Models, Molecular; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular; Nucleocapsid Proteins; Protein Folding; Protein Stability; Protein Structure, Tertiary; RNA; SARS Virus; Temperature; Thermodynamics; Transition Temperature",,"acetic acid, 127-08-2, 127-09-3, 64-19-7, 71-50-1; glycine, 56-40-6, 6000-43-7, 6000-44-8; sodium chloride, 7647-14-5; sodium dihydrogen phosphate, 7558-80-7, 7632-05-5; RNA, 63231-63-0; Nucleocapsid Proteins; RNA, 63231-63-0; nucleocapsid protein, Coronavirus",,,"202-204-234

However, the wide range of potential respiratory virus pathogens makes testing using individual real-time NATs expensive and laborious. The objective of this study was to compare the detection of respiratory virus targets using the Luminex xTAG respiratory viral panel (RVP) assay with individual real-time NATs used at the Provincial Laboratory of Public Health, Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The study included 1,530 specimens submitted for diagnosis of respiratory infections from December 2006 to May 2007. Direct-fluorescent-antigen-positive nasopharyngeal samples were excluded from this study. A total of 690 and 643 positives were detected by RVP and in-house NATs, respectively. Kappa correlation between in-house NATs and RVP for all targets ranged from 0.721 to 1.000. The majority of specimens missed by in-house NATs (96.7%) were positive for picornaviruses. Samples missed by RVP were mainly positive for adenovirus (51.7%) or respiratory syncytial virus (27.5%) by in-house NATs and in general had low viral loads. RVP allows for multiplex detection of 20 (and differentiation between 19) respiratory virus targets with considerable time and cost savings compared with alternative NATs. Although this first version of the RVP assay has lower sensitivity than in-house NATs for detection of adenovirus, it has good sensitivity for other targets. The identification of picornaviruses and coronaviruses and concurrent typing of influenza A virus by RVP, which are not currently included in our diagnostic testing algorithm, will improve our diagnosis of respiratory tract infections.

The field of bioinformatics in China has grown significantly in the past decade despite a delayed and patchy start at the end of the 1980s by a few scientists from other disciplines, most noticeably physics and mathematics, where China's traditional strength has been. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, rapid expansion of the field was fueled by the Internet boom and genomics boom worldwide and in China. Today bioinformatics research in China is characterized by a great variety of biological questions addressed and the close collaborative efforts between computational scientists and biologists, with a full spectrum of focuses ranging from database building and algorithm development to hypothesis generation and biological discoveries. Although challenges remain, the future of bioinformatics in China is promising thanks to advances in both computing infrastructure and experimental biology research, a steady increase of governmental funding, and most importantly a critical mass of bioinformatics scientists consisting of not only converts from other disciplines but also formally trained overseas returnees and a new generation of domestically trained bioinformatics Ph.D.s. © 2008 Wei, Yu.",,"complementary DNA;

Some of these technologies such as that from Illumina's Solexa Sequencing, produce high genomic coverage by generating a very large number of small reads (∼30 bp). While prior work shows that partial assembly can be performed by k-mer extension in error-free reads, this algorithm is unsuccessful with the sequencing error rates found in practice.

Active compounds (such as substrate analogues, natural products and inhibitors of related proteins) are often identified in low throughput validation studies on a biochemical target. Sometimes the additional structural information is also available from crystallographic studies on protein and ligand complexes. In addition, the structural or sequence similarity of various protein targets yields a novel possibility for drug discovery. Co-crystallized compounds from homologous proteins can be used to design leads for a new target without co-crystallized ligands. In this paper we evaluate how far such an approach can be used in a real drug campaign, with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus providing an example. Our method is able to construct small molecules as plausible inhibitors solely on the basis of the set of ligands from crystallized complexes of a protein target, and other proteins from its structurally homologous family. The accuracy and sensitivity of the method are estimated here by the subsequent use of an electronic high throughput screening flexible docking algorithm. The best performing ligands are then used for a very restrictive similarity search for potential inhibitors of the SARS protease within the million compounds from the Ligand.Info small molecule meta-database. The selected molecules can be passed on for further experimental validation. © IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Crystallography; Drug delivery; Ligands; Molecular structure; Substrates; Active molecules; Ligand complexes; Throughput validation; Enzyme inhibition",,,,,,,,,,"Abdel-Meguid, S.S., Al, E., An orally bioavailable HIV-1 protease inhibitor containing an imidazole-derived peptide bond replacement: Crystallographic and pharmacokinetic analysis (1994) Biochemistry, 33, pp. 11671-11677; Amblard, M., Al, E., Synthesis and biological evaluation of cholecystokinin analogs in which the Asp-Phe-NH2 moiety has been replaced by a 3-amino-7-phenylheptanoic acid or a 3-amino-6-(phenyloxy)hexanoic acid (1993) J.

It was observed through docking studies that the van der Waals interactions made substantial contributions to the affinity, and that the receptor active pocket was too large for MDL21870 but more suitable for MOL736. Accordingly, MOL736 might possibly become a promising lead compound for CTSL inhibition for SARS therapy. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","Docking; KZ7088; MDL28170; Molecular simulation; Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); Structural bioinformatics","[1 [(1 formyl 2 phenylethyl)carbamoyl] 2 methylpropyl]carbamic acid benzyl ester; aurantiamide acetate; cathepsin L; herbaceous agent; mol 736; unclassified drug; article; asthma; binding affinity; Chinese medicine; coughing; drug conformation; drug efficacy; drug receptor binding; drug screening; priority journal; severe acute respiratory syndrome; simulation; Algorithms; Cathepsins; Computer Simulation; Cysteine Endopeptidases; Databases, Factual; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Enzyme Precursors; Humans; Models, Molecular; Molecular Conformation; Molecular Structure; Plant Preparations; Protease Inhibitors; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; SARS coronavirus",,"[1 [(1 formyl 2 phenylethyl)carbamoyl] 2 methylpropyl]carbamic acid benzyl ester, 88191-84-8; cathepsin L, 60616-82-2; Cathepsins, 3.4.-; Cysteine Endopeptidases, 3.4.22.-; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Enzyme Precursors; Plant Preparations; Protease Inhibitors; cathepsin L, 3.4.22.15","mdl 28170; mol 736",,,,,,,"Anand, K., Ziebuhr, J., Wadhwani, P., Mesters, J.R., Hilgenfeld, R., Coronavirus main proteinase (3CL(pro)) structure: Basis for design of anti-SARS drugs (2003) Science, 300, pp. 1763-1767; Bron, R.D., Martin, Y.C., Use of structure-activity data to compare structure-based clustering: Methods and descriptors for use in compound selection (1996) J Chem Info Comput Sci, 36, pp. 572-584; Chou, K.C., Review: Structural bioinformatics and its impact to biomedical science (2004) Curr Med Chem, 11, pp. 2105-2134; Chou, K.C., Modelling extracellular domains of GABA-A receptors: Subtypes 1, 2, 3, and 5 (2004) Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 316, pp. 636-642; Chou, K.C., Insights from modelling three-dimensional structures of the human potassium and sodium channels (2004) J Proteome Res, 3, pp. 856-861; Chou, K.C., Insights from modelling the tertiary structure of BACE2 (2004) J Proteome Res, 3, pp. 1069-1072; Chou, K.C., Insights from modelling the 3D structure of the extracellular domain of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (2004) Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 319, pp. 433-438; Chou, K.C., Coupling interaction between thromboxane A2 receptor and alpha-13 subunit of guanine nucleotide-binding protein (2005) J Proteome Res, 4, pp. 1681-1686; Chou, K.C., Modeling the tertiary structure of human cathepsin-E (2005) Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 331, pp. 56-60; Chou, K.C., Howe, W.J., Prediction of the tertiary structure of the beta-secretase zymogen (2002) Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 292, pp. 702-708; Chou, K.C., Watenpaugh, K.D., Heinrikson, R.L., A Model of the complex between cyclin-dependent kinase 5(Cdk5) and the activation domain of neuronal Cdk5 activator (1999) Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 259, pp. 420-428; Chou, K.C., Tomasselli, A.G., Heinrikson, R.L., Prediction of the tertiary structure of a caspase-9/inhibitor complex (2000) FEBS Lett, 470, pp. 249-256; Chou, K.C., Wei, D.Q., Zhong, W.Z., Binding mechanism of coronavirus main proteinase with ligands and its implication to drug design against SARS.

Its surface glycoprotein (spike protein) is considered to be one of the prime targets for SARS therapeutics and intervention because its proteolytic maturation by a host protease is crucial for host-virus fusion. Using intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic (IQF) peptides based on hSARS-CoV spike protein (Abz-755Glu-Gln-Asp-Arg-Asn-Thr-Arg-Glu-Val- Phe-Ala-Gln766-Tyx-NH2) and in vitro studies, we show that besides furin, other PCs, like PCS and PC7, might also be involved in this cleavage event. Through kinetic measurements with recombinant PCs, we observed that the peptide was cleaved efficiently by both furin and PC5, but very poorly by PC7. The cleavage could be blocked by a PC-inhibitor, α1-PDX, in a dose-dependent manner. Circular dichroism spectra indicated that this peptide possesses a high degree of sheet structure. Following cleavage by furin, the sheet content increased, possibly at the expense of turn and random structures. 1H NMR spectra from 2D COSY and ROESY experiments under physiological buffer and pH conditions indicated that this peptide possesses a structure with a turn at its C-terminal segment, close to the cleavage site. The data suggest that the cleavable peptide bond is located within the most exposed domain; this is supported by the nearby turn structure. Several strong to weak NMR ROESY correlations were detected, and a 3D structure of the spike IQF peptide that contains the crucial cleavage site R761 ↓E has been proposed. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

Biases inherent in random PCR-amplification, cross-hybridization effects, and inadequate microarray analysis, however, limit detection sensitivity and specificity. Here, we have studied the relationships between viral amplification efficiency, hybridization signal, and target-probe annealing specificity using a customized microarray platform. Novel features of this platform include the development of a robust algorithm that accurately predicts PCR bias during DNA amplification and can be used to improve PCR primer design, as well as a powerful statistical concept for inferring pathogen identity from probe recognition signatures. Compared to real-time PCR, the microarray platform identified pathogens with 94% accuracy (76% sensitivity and 100% specificity) in a panel of 36 patient specimens. Our findings show that microarrays can be used for the robust and accurate diagnosis of pathogens, and further substantiate the use of microarray technology in clinical diagnostics. © 2007 Wong et al.;

However, a substantial percentage of these ORFs have no significant sequence similarity to those of known proteins, which complicates the task for probing their function. Computational methods complement or in combination with sequence alignment and clustering methods are being explored. In this work, we represent a learning algorithm-based method for functional classification of ORFs in complete genomes of 4 different viruses HIV-1, hepatitis B, human adenovirus and SARS coronavirus. Of the 80 functionally-annotated ORFs in all these viral genomes, 85% have the predicted functional classes in various degrees consistent with the annotated functions, 12.5% are misclassified and 2.5% are unpredictable by class because the corresponding annotated classes are not covered by SVMProt. Our study suggests that our SVMProt may, to a certain extent, provide useful hint about the function of the ORFs in the viral genomes.","Function annotation; ORF; SVM; Viral genome","Classification (of information);

However, within each strand there are considerable local deviations from the A = T and G = C equality. These asymmetries in nucleotide composition have been extensively analyzed in prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes and related to chromosome organization, transcription orientation and other processes in certain organisms. To carry out analysis of intra-strand nucleotide distribution several graphical methods have been developed. Results: GraphDNA is a new Java application that provides a simple, user-friendly interface for the visualization of DNA nucleotide composition. The program accepts GenBank, EMBL and FASTA files as an input, and it displays multiple DNA nucleotide composition graphs (skews and walks) in a single window to allow direct comparisons between the sequences. We illustrate the use of DNA skews for characterization of poxvirus and coronavirus genomes. Conclusion: GraphDNA is a platform-independent, Open Source, tool for the analysis of nucleotide trends in DNA sequences. Multiple sequence formats can be read and multiple sequences may be plotted in a single results window. © 2007 Thomas et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Composition analysis; Eukaryotic genome; Graphical displays;

A limited set of algorithms exists for estimating the rate of nucleotide substitution and inferring phylogenetic trees from such data. The authors here present a new method, Tree and Rate Estimation by Local Evaluation (TREBLE) that robustly calculates the rate of nucleotide substitution and phylogeny with several orders of magnitude improvement in computational time. Methods: For the basis of its rate estimation TREBLE novelly utilizes a geometric interpretation of the molecular clock assumption to deduce a local estimate of the rate of nucleotide substitution for triplets of dated sequences. Averaging the triplet estimates via a variance weighting yields a global estimate of the rate. From this value, an iterative refinement procedure relying on statistical properties of the triplets then generates a final estimate of the global rate of nucleotide substitution. The estimated global rate is then utilized to find the tree from the pairwise distance matrix via an UPGMA-like algorithm. Results: Simulation studies show that TREBLE estimates the rate of nucleotide substitution with point estimates comparable with the best of available methods. Confidence intervals are comparable with that of BEAST. TREBLE's phylogenetic reconstruction is significantly improved over the other distance matrix method but not as accurate as the Bayesian algorithm. Compared with three other algorithms, TREBLE reduces computational time by a minimum factor of 3000. Relative to the algorithm with the most accurate estimates for the rate of nucleotide substitution (i.e. BEAST), TREBLE is over 10 times more computationally efficient. © 2007 Oxford University Press.",,"nucleotide; article; Bayes theorem; data analysis; data analysis software; data base; Dengue virus; gene sequence; genetic algorithm; information processing; information retrieval; intermethod comparison; mathematical computing; molecular evolution; nonhuman; nucleic acid base substitution; nucleotide sequence; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; priority journal; SARS coronavirus; sequence database; severe acute respiratory syndrome; structural genomics; Chromosome Mapping; Computer Simulation; DNA Mutational Analysis; Evolution, Molecular; Kinetics; Models, Genetic; Nucleotides; Phylogeny; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Time Factors; RNA viruses",,"Nucleotides","BEAST; PEBBLE; Tree and Rate Estimation by Local Evaluation",,"National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS: 5T32GM008185

It has been used to discover serum or tissue protein signatures and biomarkers for infectious diseases in the fields of virology (hepatitis B and C viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome, HIV-1, human T-cell leukemia virus-1 and BK virus), parasitology (trypanosomiasis) and bacteriology (intra-amniotic inflammation, tuberculosis and bacterial endocarditis). The protein signatures, or biomarkers, can be used to diagnose infection, predict disease states and to inform on disease processes. Careful attention to experimental design, sample handling and storage, and the use of appropriate internal controls is crucial to success. © 2007 Future Medicine Ltd.","Biomarkers; Diagnostics; Mass spectrometry; Proteomic signature; Proteomics; SELDI; SELDI-TOF; Serum; Surface enhanced laser desorption ionization-time of flight","alpha fetoprotein; BCG vaccine; beta 2 microglobulin; biological marker; calgranulin; complement component C3c; defensin; immunoglobulin heavy chain; peginterferon; ribavirin; bacterial endocarditis; bacterial infection; bacterium culture; BK virus; blood analysis; cancer risk; clinical feature; clinical trial; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic value; differential diagnosis; disease association; disease classification; disease marker; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; genetic algorithm; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; hepatitis C; Hepatitis C virus; histopathology; human; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection; Human T cell leukemia virus 1; Human T cell leukemia virus infection; infection risk; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; liver fibrosis; microbiological examination; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; parasitosis; prediction; priority journal; review; risk assessment; risk factor; SARS coronavirus; sensitivity and specificity; severe acute respiratory syndrome; surface enhanced laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; Trypanosoma; trypanosomiasis; tuberculin test; tuberculosis; virus detection; virus infection; virus strain; Western blotting; Biological Markers; Communicable Diseases; Humans; Proteome; Proteomics; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Bacteria (microorganisms); BK polyomavirus; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Human T-lymphotropic virus 1",,"beta 2 microglobulin, 9066-69-7; ribavirin, 36791-04-5; Biological Markers; Proteome",,,,,,,,"Villar-Garea, A., Griese MImhof, A., Biomarker discovery from body fluids using mass spectrometry (2006) J.

With the discovery of SARS-CoV in 2003, a third family member was identified. Soon thereafter, we described the fourth human coronavirus (HCoV-NL63), a virus that has spread worldwide and is associated with croup in children. We report here the complete genome sequence of two HCoV-NL63 clinical isolates, designated Amsterdam 57 and Amsterdam 496. The genomes are 27,538 and 27,550 nucleotides long, respectively, and share the same genome organization. We identified two variable regions, one within the 1a and one within the S gene, whereas the 1b and N genes were most conserved. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that HCoV-NL63 genomes have a mosaic structure with multiple recombination sites. Additionally, employing three different algorithms, we assessed the evolutionary rate for the S gene of group Ib coronaviruses to be ∼ 3 × 10- 4 substitutions per site per year. Using this evolutionary rate we determined that HCoV-NL63 diverged in the 11th century from its closest relative HCoV-229E. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed model offers considerable potentials, considering the inconsistency of existing methods for predicting novel proteins. Because some novel proteins might align without meaningful conserved domains, maximizing the score of sequence alignment is not the best criterion for predicting protein functions. This work presents a decision model that can minimize the cost of making a decision for predicting protein functions using the hierarchical homologies. Particularly, the model has three characteristics: (i) it is a hybrid evolutionary model with multiple fitness functions that uses genetic programming to predict protein functions on a distantly related protein family, (ii) it incorporates modified robust point matching to accurately compare all feature points using the moment invariant and thin-plate spline theorems, and (iii) the hierarchical homologies holding up a novel protein sequence in the form of a causal tree can effectively demonstrate the relationship between proteins. This work describes the comparisons of nucleocapsid proteins from the putative polyprotein SARS virus and other coronaviruses in other hosts using the model. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we combined screening of phage display random peptide libraries with a unique computer algorithm ""Mapitope"" to identify the discontinuous epitope of 80R, a potent neutralizing human anti-SARS monoclonal antibody against the spike protein. Using two different types of random peptide libraries which display cysteine-constrained loops or linear 13-15-mer peptides, independent panels containing 42 and 18 peptides were isolated, respectively. These peptides, which had no apparent homologous motif within or between the peptide pools and spike protein, were deconvoluted into amino acid pairs (AAPs) by Mapitope and the statistically significant pairs (SSPs) were defined. Mapitope analysis of the peptides was first performed on a theoretical model of the spike and later on the genuine crystal structure. Three clusters (A, B and C) were predicted on both structures with remarkable overlap. Cluster A ranked the highest in the algorithm in both models and coincided well with the sites of spike protein that are in contact with the receptor, consistent with the observation that 80R functions as a potent entry inhibitor. This study demonstrates that by using this novel strategy one can rapidly predict and identify a neutralizing antibody epitope, even in the absence of the crystal structure of its target protein. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

To address this issue, we developed a computational method that identifies the conserved viral sequences at the genus level for all viral genomes available in GenBank, and established a virus probe library. The virus probes are used not only to identify known viruses but also for discerning the genera of emerging or uncharacterized ones. Results: Using the microarray approach, the identity of the virus in a test sample is determined by the signals of both genus and species-specific probes. The genera of emerging and uncharacterized viruses are determined based on hybridization of the viral sequences to the conserved probes for the existing viral genera. A detection and classification procedure to determine the identity of a virus directly from detection signals results in the rapid identification of the virus. Conclusion: We have demonstrated the validity and feasibility of the above strategy with a small number of viral samples. The probe design algorithm can be applied to any publicly available viral sequence database. The strategy of using separate genus and species probe sets enables the use of a straightforward virus identity calculation directly based on the hybridization signals. Our virus identification strategy has great potential in the diagnosis of viral infections.

L8S 4K1, Canada","The well-known formula for the final size of an epidemic was published by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927. Their analysis was based on a simple susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model that assumes exponentially distributed infectious periods. More recent analyses have established that the standard final size formula is valid regardless of the distribution of infectious periods, but that it fails to be correct in the presence of certain kinds of heterogeneous mixing (e.g., if there is a core group, as for sexually transmitted diseases). We review previous work and establish more general conditions under which Kermack and McKendrick's formula is valid. We show that the final size formula is unchanged if there is a latent stage, any number of distinct infectious stages and/or a stage during which infectives are isolated (the durations of each stage can be drawn from any integrable distribution). We also consider the possibility that the transmission rates of infectious individuals are arbitrarily distributed-allowing, in particular, for the existence of super-spreaders-and prove that this potential complexity has no impact on the final size formula. Finally, we show that the final size formula is unchanged even for a general class of spatial contact structures. We conclude that whenever a new respiratory pathogen emerges, an estimate of the expected magnitude of the epidemic can be made as soon the basic reproduction number ℛ0 can be approximated, and this estimate is likely to be improved only by more accurate estimates of ℛ0, not by knowledge of any other epidemiological details. © Society for Mathematical Biology 2006.","Arbitrary stage durations; Epidemic models; Final size; Integro-differential equations 1991 MSC:92D30","algorithm; article; biological model; communicable disease; disease transmission; epidemic; growth, development and aging; human; pathogenicity; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; statistics; time; virology; Algorithms; Communicable Diseases; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Models, Biological; SARS Virus; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Time Factors",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, D., Watson, R., On the spread of a disease with gamma distributed latent and infectious periods (1980) Biometrika, 67 (1), pp. 191-198; Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., (1991) Infectious Diseases of Humans:Dynamics and Control, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Anderson, R.M., Medley, G.F., May, R.M., Johnson, A.M., A preliminary study of the transmission dynamics of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent of AIDS (1986) IMA J.

These microarrays were used to screen ≈400 Canadian sera from the SARS outbreak, including samples from confirmed SARS-CoV cases, respiratory illness patients, and healthcare professionals. A computer algorithm that uses multiple classifiers to predict samples from SARS patients was developed and used to predict 206 sera from Chinese fever patients. The test assigned patients into two distinct groups: those with antibodies to SARS-CoV and those without. The microarray also identified patients with sera reactive against other coronavirus proteins. Our results correlated well with an indirect immunofluorescence test and demonstrated that viral infection can be monitored for many months after infection. We show that protein microarrays can serve as a rapid, sensitive, and simple tool for large-scale identification of viral-specific antibodies in sera. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Infectious disease; Protein chip; Virus diagnostics","proteome; virus antibody; virus protein; algorithm; article; Canada; China; computer system; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; epidemic; human; immunofluorescence; major clinical study; microarray analysis; nonhuman; patient monitoring; priority journal; SARS coronavirus; screening test; severe acute respiratory syndrome; virus detection; Algorithms; Amino Acid Sequence; Antibodies, Viral; Canada; China; Disease Outbreaks; Double-Blind Method; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect; Humans; Molecular Sequence Data; Protein Array Analysis; Proteome; SARS Virus; Sensitivity and Specificity; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Viral Proteins; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus",,"Antibodies, Viral; Proteome; Viral Proteins",,,,,,,,"Donnelly, C.A., Ghani, A.C., Leung, G.M., Hedley, A.J., Fraser, C., Riley, S., Abu-Raddad, L.J., Chau, P., (2003) Lancet, 361, pp. 1761-1766; McIntosh, K., Chao, R.K., Krause, H.E., Wasil, R., Mocega, H.E., Mufson, M.A., (1974) J.

Presently, influenza virus A H3N2 and respiratory syncytial virus are the most commonly identified viral pathogens in older adults with viral pneumonia. As diagnostic tests such as reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction become more widely used, the relative importance of additional viruses (such as parainfluenza, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and human metapneumovirus) will likely increase. Influenza virus should be considered as a cause of pneumonia during the winter months, especially during periods of peak activity. Patients with high-grade fever, myalgias, and cough should arouse the highest suspicion. Respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia should also be suspected during the winter in patients with coryza, wheezing, low-grade fever, and patchy infiltrates, especially if negative for influenza on rapid testing. Because clinical features and periods of activity for many viruses overlap, laboratory confirmation of influenza is recommended for cases involving seriously ill or institutionalized patients. © 2006 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

The GeneMark systems for gene-finding in virus and phage genomes suffer from some basic drawbacks. This paper puts forward an alternative approach for viral and phage gene-finding to improve the quality of annotations, particularly for newly sequenced genomes. Results: The new system ZCURVE_V has been run for 979 viral and 212 phage genomes, respectively, and satisfactory results are obtained. To have a fair comparison with the currently available software of similar function, GeneMark, a total of 30 viral genomes that have not been annotated by GeneMark are selected to be tested. Consequently, the average specificity of both systems is well matched, however the average sensitivity of ZCURVE_V for smaller viral genomes (< 100 kb), which constitute the main parts of viral genomes sequenced so far, is higher than that of GeneMark. Additionally, for the genome of Amsacta moorei entomopoxvirus, probably with the lowest genomic GC content among the sequenced organisms, the accuracy of ZCURVE_V is much better than that of GeneMark, because the later predicts hundreds of false-positive genes. ZCURVE_V is also used to analyze well-studied genomes, such as HIV-1, HBV and SARS-CoV. Accordingly, the performance of ZCURVE_V is generally better than that of GeneMark. Finally, ZCURVE_V may be downloaded and run locally, particularly facilitating its utilization, whereas GeneMark is not downloadable. Based on the above comparison, it is suggested that ZCURVE_V may serve as a preferred gene-finding tool for viral and phage genomes newly sequenced. However, it is also shown that the joint application of both systems, ZCURVE_V and GeneMark, leads to better gene-finding results.

In this study, 51 stool samples of calves from 10 Brazilian dairy farms were analysed by an RT-PCR that amplifies a 488-bp fragment of the hypervariable region of the spike glycoprotein gene. Maximum parsimony genealogy with a heuristic algorithm using sequences from 15 field strains studied here and 10 sequences from GenBank and bredavirus as an outgroup virus showed the existence of two major clusters (1 and 2) in this viral species, the Brazilian strains segregating in both of them. The mean nucleotide identity between the 15 Brazilian strains was 98.34%, with a mean amino acid similarity of 98%. Strains from cluster 2 showed a deletion of 6 amino acids inside domain II of the spike protein that was also found in human coronavirus strain OC43, supporting the recent proposal of a zoonotic spill- over of BCoV. These results contribute to the molecular characterization of BCoV, to the prediction of the efficiency of immunogens, and to the definition of molecular markers useful for epidemiologic surveys on coronavirus-caused diseases. © Springer-Verlag 2006.",,"Bovine coronavirus; Coronavirus","GENBANK: AY255831, AY606192, AY606193, AY606194, AY606195, AY606196, AY606197, AY606198, AY606199, AY606200, AY606201, AY606202, AY606203, AY606204, AY606205",,,,,,,,,"Abraham, S., Kienzle, T.E., Lapps, W., Brian, D.A., Deduced sequence of the bovine coronavirus spike protein and identification of the internal proteolytic cleavage site (1990) Virology, 176, pp. 296-301; Akashi, H., Inaba, Y., Miura, Y., Tokuhisha, S., Sato, K., Satoda, K., Properties of a coronavirus isolated from a cow with epizootic diarrhea (1980) Vet Microbiol, 5, pp. 265-276; Baric, R.S., Yount, B., Hensley, L., Peel, S.A., Chen, W., Episodic evolution mediates interspecies transfer of a murine coronavirus (1997) J Virol, 71, pp. 1946-1955; Benfield, D.A., Saif, L.J., Cell culture propagation of a bovine coronavirus isolated from cows with winter dysentery (1990) J Clin Microbiol, 28, pp. 1454-1457; Bergmann, C.C., Yao, Q., Lin, M., Stohlman, S.A., The JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus induces a spike protein-specific Db-restricted cytotoxic T cell response (1996) J Gen Virol, 77, pp. 315-325; Boireau, P., Cruciere, C., Laporte, J., Nucleotide sequence of the glycoprotein S gene of bovine enteric coronavirus and comparison with the S proteins of two mouse hepatitis virus strains (1990) J Gen Virol, 71, pp. 487-492; Bonavia, A., Zelus, B.D., Wentworth, D.E., Talbot, P.J., Holmes, K.V., Identification of a receptor-binding domain of the spike glycoprotein of human coronavirus HCoV-229E (2003) J Virol, 77, pp. 2530-2538; Brandão, P.E., Birgel Jr., E.H., Gregori, F., Rosales, C.A.R., Ruiz, V.L.A., Jerez, J.A., Bovine coronavirus detection in adult cows in Brazil (2002) Arq Inst Biol (São Paulo), 6, pp. 103-104; Calcagnotto, D., Matioli, S.R., Taxas de evolução e o relógio molecular (2001) Biologia Molecular e Evolução, pp. 51-63. , Holos São Paulo; Castro, R.F., Perlman, S., CD8+ T cells epitopes within the surface glycoprotein of a neurotropic coronavirus and correlation with pathogenicity (1995) J Virol, 69, pp. 8127-8131; Cavanagh, D., Siddell, S.G., The coronavirus surface glycoprotein (1995) The Coronaviridae, pp. 73-113. , Plenum Press New York; Chouljenko, V.N., Lin, X.Q., Storz, J., Kousoulas, K.G., Gorbalenya, A.E., Comparison of genomic and predicted amino acid sequences of respiratory and enteric bovine coronaviruses isolated from the same animal with fatal shipping pneumonia (2001) J Gen Virol, 82, pp. 2927-2933; Collins, A.R., Knobler, R.L., Powell, H., Buchmeier, M.J., Monoclonal antibodies to murine hepatitis virus-4 (strain JHM) define the viral glycoprotein responsible for cell attachment and cell-cell fusion (1982) Virology, 119, pp. 358-371; Compton, S.R., Vivas-Gonzalez, B.E., MacY, J.D., Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-based diagnosis and molecular characterization of a new rat coronavirus strain (1999) Lab Anim Sci, 49, pp. 506-513; Crucière, C., Laporte, J., Sequence and analysis of bovine enteric coronavirus (F15) genome I.

First reported in Asia, SARS quickly spread worldwide through international travelling. As of July 2003, the World Health Organization reported a total of 8,437 people afflicted with SARS with a 9.6% mortality rate. Although immunopathological damages may account for the severity of respiratory distress, little is known about how the genome-wide gene expression of the host changes under the attack of SARS-CoV. Results: Based on changes in gene expression of peripheral blood, we identified 52 signature genes that accurately discriminated acute SARS patients from non-SARS controls. While a general suppression of gene expression predominated in SARS-infected blood, several genes including those involved in innate immunity, such as defensins and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, were upregulated. Instead of employing clustering methods, we ranked the severity of recovering SARS patients by generalized associate plots (GAP) according to the expression profiles of 52 signature genes. Through this method, we discovered a smooth transition pattern of severity from normal controls to acute SARS patients. The rank of SARS severity was significantly correlated with the recovery period (in days) and with the clinical pulmonary infection score. Conclusions: The use of the GAP approach has proved useful in analyzing the complexity and continuity of biological systems. The severity rank derived from the global expression profile of significantly regulated genes in patients may be useful for further elucidating the pathophysiology of their disease. © 2005 Lee et al., licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"actin binding protein; calmodulin; carrier protein; colony stimulating factor receptor; complementary DNA; cyclin dependent kinase; cyclin G1; cytochrome P450 17; defensin; elongation factor; elongation factor B; eosinophil protein X; fk 506 binding protein; glutathione peroxidase; histone deacetylase 1; homeodomain protein; initiation factor 4A; isoleucine transfer RNA ligase; leucine zipper protein; myosin light chain; n acetylglucosaminyltransferase; nucleolin; polyadenylic acid binding protein; progesterone receptor; serine proteinase; small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; thiopurine methyltransferase; tropomyosin; unclassified drug; zinc finger protein; complementary DNA; article; cluster analysis; controlled study; correlation analysis; diagnostic accuracy; disease severity; DNA microarray; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; gene identification; genetic algorithm; human; immunity; lung infection; molecular genetics; pathophysiology; SARS coronavirus; scoring system; severe acute respiratory syndrome; upregulation; algorithm; biological model; biology; blood; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; gene expression; gene expression regulation; genetics; genome; innate immunity; lung disease; metabolism; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; statistical model; virology; virus gene; Coronavirus; SARS CoV; Algorithms; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; DNA, Complementary; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation, Viral; Genes, Viral; Genome; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Lung Diseases; Models, Genetic; Models, Statistical; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; SARS Virus; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Up-Regulation",,"carrier protein, 80700-39-6; cyclin dependent kinase, 150428-23-2; eosinophil protein X, 219853-92-6; glutathione peroxidase, 9013-66-5; isoleucine transfer RNA ligase, 9030-96-0; n acetylglucosaminyltransferase, 9054-49-3; nucleolin, 126469-19-0; serine proteinase, 37259-58-8; thiopurine methyltransferase, 67339-09-7; tropomyosin, 72067-79-9; DNA, Complementary",,,,,,,,"Rota, P.A., Oberste, M.S., Monroe, S.S., Nix, W.A., Campagnoli, R., Icenogle, J.P., Penaranda, S., Chen, M.H., Characterization of a novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003) Science, 300 (5624), pp. 1394-1399; Marra, M.A., Jones, S.J., Astell, C.R., Holt, R.A., Brooks-Wilson, A., Butterfield, Y.S., Khattra, J., Chan, S.Y., The Genome sequence of the SARS-associated coronavirus (2003) Science, 300 (5624), pp. 1399-1404; Peiris, J.S., Lai, S.T., Poon, L.L., Guan, Y., Yam, L.Y., Lim, W., Nicholls, J., Cheung, M.T., Coronavirus as a possible cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003) Lancet, 361 (9366), pp. 1319-1325; Ruan, Y.J., Wei, C.L., Ee, A.L., Vega, V.B., Thoreau, H., Su, S.T., Chia, J.M., Lim, L., Comparative full-length genome sequence analysis of 14 SARS coronavirus isolates common mutations associated with putative origins of infection (2003) Lancet, 361 (9371), pp. 1779-1785; Drosten, C., Gunther, S., Preiser, W., van der Werf, S., Brodt, H.R., Becker, S., Rabenau, H., Fouchier, R.A., Identification of a novel coronavirus in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003) N.

Identification of their function facilitates a mechanistic understanding of SARS infection and drug development for its treatment. The sequence of the majority of these putative proteins has no significant similarity to those of known proteins, which complicates the task of using sequence analysis tools to probe their function. Support vector machines (SVM), useful for predicting the functional class of distantly related proteins, is employed to ascribe a possible functional class to SARS-CoV proteins. Testing results indicate that SVM is able to predict the functional class of 73% of the known SARS-CoV proteins with available sequences and 67% of 18 other novel viral proteins. A combination of the sequence comparison method BLAST and SVMProt can further improve the prediction accuracy of SMVProt such that the functional class of two additional SARS-CoV proteins is correctly predicted. Our study suggests that the SARS-CoV genome possibly contains a putative voltage-gated ion channel, structural proteins, a carbon-oxygen lyase, oxidoreductases acting on the CH-OH group of donors, and an ATP-binding cassette transporter.

Previous phylogenetic analyses based on sequence alignments show that SARS-CoVs form a new group distantly related to the other three groups of previously characterized coronaviruses. In this paper, a geometric approach based on the Z-curve representation of the whole genome sequence is proposed to analyze the phylogenetic relationships of coronaviruses. The evolutionary distances are obtained through measuring the differences among the three-dimensional Z-curves. The Z-curve is approximately described by its geometric center and the associated three eigenvectors, which indicate the center position and the trend of the Z-curve, respectively. Although some information is lost due to the approximate description of the Z-curve, the phylogenetic tree constructed based on these parameters is consistent with those of previous analyses. The present method has the merits of simplicity and intuitiveness, but it is still in its premature stage. Because the phylogenetic relationships are inferred from the whole genome, instead of some individual genes, the present method represents a new direction of phylogeny study in the post-genome era. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

A critical challenge to scientists from various disciplines worldwide is to study the specificity of cleavage activity of SARS-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and use the knowledge obtained from the study for effective inhibitor design to fight the disease. The most commonly used inductive programming methods for knowledge discovery from data assume that the elements of input patterns are orthogonal to each other. Suppose a sub-sequence is denoted as P2-P1-P1′,-P2′, the conventional inductive programming method may result in a rule like 'if P1 = Q, then the sub-sequence is cleaved, otherwise non-cleaved'. If the site P1 is not orthogonal to the others (for instance, P2, P1′, and P2′,), the prediction power of these kind of rules may be limited. Therefore this study is aimed at developing a novel method for constructing non-orthogonal decision trees for mining protease data. Result: Eighteen sequences of coronavirus polyprotein were downloaded from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Among these sequences, 252 cleavage sites were experimentally determined. These sequences were scanned using a sliding window with size k to generate about 50 000 k-mer sub-sequences (for short, k-mers). The value of k varies from 4 to 12 with a gap of two. The bio-basis function proposed by Thomson et al. is used to transform the k-mers to a high-dimensional numerical space on which an inductive programming method is applied for the purpose of deriving a decision tree for decision-making. The process of this transform is referred to as a bio-mapping. The constructed decision trees select about 10 out of 50 000 k-mers. This small set of selected k-mers is regarded as a set of decisive templates. By doing so, non-orthogonal decision trees are constructed using the selected templates and the prediction accuracy is significantly improved. © The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University Press.

From November 2002 to July 2003 the cumulative number of worldwide cases was >8000, with a mortality rate of close to 10%. The mortality has been higher in older patients and those with co-morbidities. SARS has been defined using clinical and epidemiological criteria and cases are considered laboratory-confirmed if SARS coronavirus is isolated, if antibody to SARS coronavirus is detected, or a polymerase chain reaction test by appropriate criteria is positive. At the time of writing (24 May 2004), no specific therapy has been recommended. A variety of treatments have been attempted, but there are no controlled data. Most patients have been treated throughout the illness with broad-spectrum antimicrobials, supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids, and other supportive measures. Transmission of SARS is facilitated by close contact with patients with symptomatic infection. The majority of cases have been reported among healthcare providers and family members of SARS patients. Since SARS-CoV is contagious, measures for prevention center on avoidance of exposure, and infection control strategies for suspected cases and contacts. This includes standard precautions (hand hygiene), contact precautions (gowns, goggles, gloves) and airborne precautions (negative pressure rooms and high efficiency masks). In light of reports of new cases identified during the winter of 2003-4 in China, it seems possible that SARS will be an important cause of pneumonia in the future, and the screening of outpatients at risk for SARS may become part of the pneumonia evaluation. © 2005 Adis Data Information BV.

To use this algorithm for multiple-sequence evolutionary modelling, it would be useful to apply the EM algorithm to estimate not only the probability parameters of the stochastic grammar, but also the instantaneous mutation rates of the underlying evolutionary model (to facilitate the development of stochastic grammars based on phylogenetic trees, also known as Statistical Alignment). Recently, we showed how to do this for the point substitution component of the evolutionary process; here, we extend these results to the indel process. Results: We present an algorithm for maximum-likelihood estimation of insertion and deletion rates from multiple sequence alignments, using EM, under the single-residue indel model owing to Thorne, Kishino and Felsenstein (the 'TKF91' model). The algorithm converges extremely rapidly, gives accurate results on simulated data that are an improvement over parsimonious estimates (which are shown to underestimate the true indel rate), and gives plausible results on experimental data (coronavirus envelope domains). Owing to the algorithm's close similarity to the Baum-Welch algorithm for training hidden Markov models, it can be used in an 'unsupervised' fashion to estimate rates for unaligned sequences, or estimate several sets of rates for sequences with heterogenous rates. © The Author 2005.

Respiratory protection and negative-pressure rooms are needed to prevent transmission of airborne-spread diseases, but US hospitals lack available and/or properly functioning negative-pressure rooms. Creating new rooms or retrofitting existing facilities is time-consuming and expensive. Methods: Safe methods of managing patients with airborne-spread diseases and establishing temporary negative-pressure and/or protective environments were determined by a literature review. Relevant data were analyzed and synthesized to generate a response algorithm. Results: Ideal patient management and placement guidelines, including instructions for choosing respiratory protection and creating temporary negative-pressure or other protective environments, were delineated. Findings were summarized in a treatment algorithm. Conclusion: The threat of bioterrorism and emerging infections increases health care's need for negative-pressure and/or protective environments. The algorithm outlines appropriate response steps to decrease transmission risk until an ideal protective environment can be utilized. Using this algorithm will prepare infection control professionals to respond more effectively during a surge of potentially infectious patients following a bioterrorism attack or emerging infectious disease outbreak.

Many homologous proteins were separated a very long time ago in their evolutionary history and thus their sequences share low sequence identity. These remote homologs have become a research focus in bioinformatics over the past decade, and some significant advances have been achieved. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review on computational techniques used in remote homolog identification based on different methods, including sequence-sequence comparison, and sequence-structure comparison, and structure-structure comparison. Other miscellaneous approaches are also summarized. Pointers to the online resources of these methods and their related databases are provided. Comparisons among different methods in terms of their technical approaches, their strengths, and limitations are followed.

Identification of antigenic regions on pathogen proteins will play a pivotal role in designer vaccine immunotherapy. We have developed a system that not only identifies high binding T-cell antigenic epitopes, but also class I T-cell antigenic clusters termed immunological hot spots. Methods: MULTIPRED, a computational system for promiscuous prediction of HLA class I binders, uses artificial neural networks (ANN) and hidden Markov models (HMM) as predictive engines. The models were rigorously trained, tested and validated using experimentally identified HLA class I T-cell epitopes from human melanoma related proteins and human papillomavirus proteins E6 and E7. We have developed a scoring scheme for identification of immunological hot spots for HLA class I molecules, which is the sum of the highest four predictions within a window of 30 amino acids. Results: Our predictions against experimental data from four melanoma-related proteins showed that MULTIPRED ANN and HMM models could predict T-cell epitopes with high accuracy. The analysis of proteins E6 and E7 showed that ANN models appear to be more accurate for prediction of HLA-A3 hot spots and HMM models for HLA-A2 predictions. For illustration of its utility we applied MULTIPRED for prediction of promiscuous T-cell epitopes in all four SARS coronavirus structural proteins. MULTIPRED predicted HLA-A2 and HLA-A3 hot spots in each of these proteins. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.",,"epitope; HLA antigen class 1; protein E6; protein E7; virus protein; antigen presentation; antigen recognition; artificial neural network; computer program; conference paper; epitope mapping; major histocompatibility complex; melanoma; prediction; priority journal; probability; T lymphocyte; Wart virus; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Epitope Mapping; Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte; Histocompatibility Antigens Class I; Models, Immunological; Oncogene Proteins, Viral; Papillomavirus E7 Proteins; Peptides; Protein Binding; Human papillomavirus; SARS coronavirus",,"E6 protein, Human papillomavirus type 6; Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte; Histocompatibility Antigens Class I; Oncogene Proteins, Viral; Papillomavirus E7 Proteins; Peptides",,,"National University of Singapore, NUS

Recently, a variety of efforts have been made to derive alignment-free methods to overcome this limitation. In this paper, we proposed a new distance metric based on the diversity increment between sequences. The distance matrix calculated by this metric can be used to construct phylogenetic trees. When using our method to construct the phylogeny of eutherian orders from the comparison of whole mtDNA sequences, we got rather good results. We also tested our method on the complete genome sequences of SARS coronavirus, the result tree is the same as what had been obtained by DNASIS, whereas the experiment illustrates that our method is much more efficient and automatic. © 2004 IEEE.","Distance metric; DNASIS; Phylogeny tree; SARS","Algorithms; Database systems; DNA; Evolutionary algorithms; Genes; Matrix algebra; Distance metric; DNASIS; Phylogeny tree; SARS; Trees (mathematics)",,,,,,,,,,"Out, H.H., Sayood, K., A new sequence distance measure for phylogenetic tree construction (2003) Bioinformatics, 19 (16), pp. 2122-2130; Sankoff, D., Leduc, G., Antoine, N., Paquin, B., Lang, B.F., Cedergen, R., Gene order comparisons for phylogenetic inference (1992) Proc.

Triage, early case detection followed by prompt isolation and quarantine are major preventive measures. Respiratory tract infections are the most common childhood illnesses and paediatric SARS poses special problems in diagnosis because of its non-specific presentation. The main lessons learnt from the outbreak were: (1) despite well established guidelines on infection control precautions, poor understanding of underlying principles and deficiencies in compliance are common among healthcare professionals, especially during emergencies; (2) even a slight lapse can be fatal; and (3) over-protection can be counterproductive. Hence it is important to: (1) be protected to protect others; (2) be vigilant and prepared for emerging infections; (3) be proficient and scrupulous in infection control measures; (4) be apposite and practical on personal protective equipments to ensure sustainability; and (5) be dutiful and prompt in informing of potential threats and work closely with others. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Clinic; Hospital; Infection control; SARS","article; child; child health care; early diagnosis; emergency health service; environmental sanitation; epidemic; face mask; fatality; health care facility; health practitioner; hospital; human; infection control; isolation procedure; medical practice; practice guideline; priority journal; protective equipment; respiratory tract disease; respiratory tract infection; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; symptomatology; virus transmission; Algorithms; Hong Kong; Humans; Infection Control; Masks; Protective Clothing; Respiratory System; SARS Virus; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Triage",,,,,,,,,,"Fong, N.C., Kwan, Y.W., Hue, Y.W., Yue, L.K., Yau, E.K.C., Leung, C.W., Chiu, M.C., Adolescent twin sisters with severe acute respiratory syndrome (2004) Pediatrics, 113, pp. e146-e149; Sit, S.C., Yau, E.K.C., Lam, Y.Y., Ng, D.K.K., Fong, N.C., Hui, Y.W., Cheng, W.F., Chiu, M.C., A young infant with severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003) Pediatrcs, 112, pp. e257-e260; Consensus document of the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (2003), p. 7. , http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/WHOconsensus.pdf, Department of Communicable Disease Surveillance and Response.

The input of the MuSiC system consists of a set of protein/DNA/RNA sequences and a set of user-specified constraints, each with a fragment of residue/nucleotide that (approximately) appears in all input sequences. The output of MuSiC is a constrained multiple sequence alignment in which the fragments of the input sequences whose residues/nucleotides exhibit a given degree of similarity to a constraint are aligned together. The current MuSiC system is implemented in Java language and can be accessed via a simple web interface. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.",,"3' untranslated region; access to information; algorithm; amino acid sequence; article; computer interface; computer language; computer program; DNA sequence; gene sequence; Internet; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; RNA sequence; SARS coronavirus; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; virus genome; Algorithms; Information Storage and Retrieval; Internet; Programming Languages; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis; Software; User-Computer Interface","GENBANK: AY291451",,"Java; Multiple Sequence Alignment with Constraints",,"NSC92-3112-B-009-002, NSC92-2213-E-009-089","The authors would like to thank Prof. Chuan Yi Tang for helpful suggestions while developing the algorithm and the program prototype of MuSiC, and the anonymous referees for many constructive comments in the presentation of this paper.

Currently, 3D structure information can be generated for up to 56% of all known proteins. However, there is considerable controversy concerning the real value of homology models for drug design. This review provides an overview of the latest developments in this area and includes selected examples of successful applications of the homology modeling technique to pharmaceutically relevant questions. In addition, the strengths and limitations of the application of homology models during all phases of the drug discovery process are discussed.","assessment of target druggability; Chemical Biology; Drug Discovery; Homology modeling; Pharmaceutical Science; prediction of animal model suitability; prediction of drug metabolism; structural bioinformatics; Structural Biology; structure-based drug design","antivirus agent; azacitidine; cytochrome P450; estradiol; glucocorticoid; mifepristone; potassium channel HERG; receptor blocking agent; retinoic acid receptor alpha antagonist; rupintrivir; thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor; thrombin inhibitor; unclassified drug; bioinformatics; common cold; conformation; crystal structure; data base; DNA methylation; drug industry; drug metabolism; drug structure; drug synthesis; enzyme induction; gene sequence; human; mutagenesis; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; protein structure; QT prolongation; review; SARS coronavirus; sequence homology; structure activity relation; Animals; Computational Biology; Drug Design; Models, Molecular; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid",,"azacitidine, 320-67-2, 52934-49-3; cytochrome P450, 9035-51-2; estradiol, 50-28-2; mifepristone, 84371-65-3; rupintrivir, 223537-30-2","ag 7088; ru 486",,,,,,,"Giersiefen, H., Modern Methods of Drug Discovery: An Introduction (2003) Modern Methods of Drug Discovery, pp. 1-18. , A.

Methods: Computer algorithm was applied to select dominant epitopes from the published sequence of spike protein of SARS-CoV. Eight peptide sequences varying from 15-mers to 39-mers were synthesized and then tested by convalescent sera. Three of them showed eviden reactivity with convalescent sera(40/46; 27/46; 24/46) were synthesized as branched pedtides, linked to KLH and were used to immunize mice to test it's immunogenicity. Results: Synthetic peptide antigens can induce high titer of specific antibodies. Intramuscular route was more efficient than nasal instillation. Conclusion: Synthetic peptide as immunogens for SARS-CoV seems to have a good prospect.","Antigenicity; Multiple antigenic peptides; SARS-CoV","antigen; epitope; keyhole limpet hemocyanin; multiple antigenic peptide; peptide; unclassified drug; vaccine; algorithm; amino acid sequence; animal experiment; animal model; antibody response; antibody titer; antigenicity; article; controlled study; convalescence; drug administration route; drug formulation; immunization; mouse; nonhuman; peptide synthesis; SARS coronavirus",,,,,,,,,,"Marra, M.A., Jones, S.J.M., Astell, C.R., The genome sequence of the SARS-associated coronavirus (2003) Science, 300 (5624), pp. 1394-1399; Ksiazek, T.G., Erdman, D., Goldsmith, C.S., A novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003) N Engl J Med, 348 (20), pp. 1953-1966; Chinese source","Zhang, H.-Q.; Laboratory of Vaccine Engineering, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, AMMS, Beijing 100850, China; email: zhq2001@263.net",,,,,,,,02545101,,ZWMZD,,"Chinese","Chin.

The availability of complete genome sequence of several strains of SARS virus provides the possibility of identification of protein-coding genes and defining their functions. Computational approach to identify protein-coding genes and their putative functions will help in designing experimental protocols. Results: In this papera novel analysis of SARS genome using gene prediction method GeneDecipher developed in our laboratory has been presented. Each of the 18 newly sequenced SARS-CoV genomes has been analyzed using GeneDecipher. In addition to polyprotein 1ab1polyprotein 1a and the four genes coding for major structural proteins spike (S), small envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), six to eight additional proteins have been predicted depending upon the strain analyzed.

Many scientists worldwide are making great efforts to study the etiology of this disease with different approaches. 13 species of SARS virus have been sequenced. However, most people still largely rely on the traditional methods with some disadvantages. In this work, we used Wolfram approach to study the relationship among SARS viruses and between SARS viruses and other types of viruses, the effect of variations on the whole genome and the advantages in the analysis of SARS based on this novel approach. As a result, the similarities between SARS viruses and other coronaviruses are not really higher than those between SARS viruses and non-coronaviruses.","Genome sequence; SARS; Visualization; Wolfram approach","article; controlled study; Coronavirus; genetic variability; genome analysis; nonhuman; respiratory tract infection; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; technique; virus genome; virus infection; virus strain; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Databases, Genetic; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Viral; Humans; Models, Genetic; SARS Virus; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus",,,,,,,,,,"Stephenson, J., Global Impact of SARS (2003) JAMA, 289, p. 2349; Mackay, B., SARS: ""A domino effect through entire system"" (2003) CMAJ, 168, p. 1308; Chandler, C., SARS attacks, China shudders (2003) Fortune, 147, p. 32; Lemonick, M.D., Park, A., The truth about SARS (2003) Time, 161, pp. 48-53; Shute, N., SARS hit home (2003) US News World Rep, 134, pp. 38-42; Kondro, W., Canadians still stung by WHO's SARS travel advisory (2003) Lancet, 361, p. 1624; Shortridge, K.F., SARS exposed, pandemic influenza lurks (2003) Lancet, 361, p. 1649; Wenzel, R.P., Edmond, M.B., Managing SARS amidst uncertainty (2003) N Engl J Med, 348, pp. 1947-1948; Parry, J., Containment of SARS depends on how it is handled in China (2003) BMJ, 326, p. 1004; Parry, J., WHO warns that death rate from SARS could reach 10% (2003) BMJ, 326, p. 999; Cameron, P.A., Rainer, T.H., De Villiers Smit, P., The SARS epidemic: Lessons for Australia (2003) Med J Aust, 178, pp. 478-479; Clark, J., Fear of SARS thwarts medical education in Toronto (2003) BMJ, 326, p. 784; Gerberding, J.L., Faster... but fast enough?

Box 2735, Beijing 100080, China","This is a review of a new and essentially simple method of inferring phylogenetic relationships from complete genome data without using sequence alignment. The method is based on counting the appearance frequency of oligopeptides of a fixed length (up to K = 6) in the collection of protein sequences of a species. It is a method without fine adjustment and choice of genes. Applied to prokaryotic genomes it has led to results comparable with the bacteriologists' systematics as reflected in the latest 2002 outline of the Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. The method has also been used to compare chloroplast genomes and to the phylogeny of Coronaviruses including human SARS-CoV. A key point in our approach is subtraction of a random background from the original counts by using a Markov model of order K - 2 in order to highlight the shaping role of natural selection. The implications of the subtraction procedure is specially analyzed and further development of the new approach is indicated. © Imperial College Press.","Composition distance; Markov model; Neutral mutations; Prokaryote phylogeny; Random background","oligopeptide; ribosome RNA; transfer RNA; amino acid sequence; analytic method; bacterial genome; chloroplast; comparative study; Coronavirus; gene frequency; gene transfer; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; probability; prokaryote; review; SARS coronavirus; sequence alignment; taxonomy; unindexed sequence; virus genome; Algorithms; Archaea; Bacteria; Base Sequence; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Genome, Bacterial; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Prokaryotic Cells; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Prokaryota","GENBANK: NC_000853, NC_000854, NC_000868, NC_000909, NC_000911, NC_000916, NC_000917, NC_000918, NC_000961, NC_000963, NC_001263, NC_001264, NC_002488, NC_002578, NC_002607, NC_002678, NC_002689, NC_002696, NC_002754, NC_002927, NC_002928, NC_002929, NC_002932, NC_002971, NC_003047, NC_003062, NC_003063, NC_003103, NC_003106, NC_003112, NC_003116, NC_003272, NC_003295, NC_003296, NC_003304, NC_003305, NC_003317, NC_003318, NC_003364, NC_003413, NC_003552, NC_003901, NC_003902, NC_003919, NC_004113, NC_004193, NC_004310, NC_004311, NC_004463, NC_004556, NC_004757, NC_005042, NC_005070, NC_005071, NC_005072, NC_005085","transfer RNA, 9014-25-9",,,"Fudan University

Based on genetic and serological relationships, groups 1, 2 and 3 were previously recognized in the Coronavirus genus. In this report we present results of comparative sequence analysis of the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N) structural proteins, and the two most conserved replicase domains, putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and RNA helicase (HEL), aimed at a revision of the Coronaviridae taxonomy. The results of pairwise comparisons involving structural and replicase proteins of the Coronavirus genus were consistent and produced percentages of sequence identities that were distributed in discontinuous clusters. Inter-group pairwise scores formed a single cluster in the lowest perceritile. No homologs of the N and E proteins have been found outside coronaviruses, and the only (very) distant homologs of S and M proteins were identified in toroviruses. Intragroup sequence conservation was higher, although for some pairs, especially those from the most diverse group 1, scores were close or even overlapped with those from the intergroup comparisons. Phylogenetic analysis of six proteins using a neighbor-joining algorithm confirmed three coronavirus groups. Comparative sequence analysis of RdRp and HEL domains were extended to include arterivirus and ronivirus homologs. The pairwise scores between sequences of the genera Coronavirus and Torovirus (22-25% and 21-25%) were found to be very close to or overlapped with the value ranges (12 to 22% and 17 to 25%) obtained for interfamily pairwise comparisons, but were much smaller than values derived from pairwise comparisons within the Coronavirus genus (63-71 % and 59-67%). Phylogenetic analysis confirmed toroviruses and coronaviruses to be separated by a large distance that is comparable to those between established nidovirus families. Based on comparison of these scores with those derived from analysis of separate ranks of several multi-genera virus families, like the Picornaviridae, a revision of the Coronaviridae taxonomy is proposed. We suggest the Coronavirus and Torovirus genera to be re-defined as two subfamilies within the Coronavirdae or two families within Nidovirales, and the current three informal coronavirus groups to be converted into three genera within the Coronaviridae.",,"Conserved Sequence; Coronaviridae; Phylogeny; RNA Helicases; RNA Replicase; Torovirus; Viral Structural Proteins; Arteriviridae; Arterivirus; Coronaviridae; Coronavirus; Nidovirales; Picornaviridae; Prokaryota; Roniviridae; Torovirus",,"RNA Helicases, EC 2.7.7.-; RNA Replicase, EC 2.7.7.48; Viral Structural Proteins",,,,,,,,"Altschul, S.F., Gish, W., Miller, W., Myers, E.W., Lipman, D.J., Basic local alignment search tool (1990) J Mol Biol, 215, pp. 403-410; Altschul, S.F., Madden, T.L., Schaffer, A.A., Zhang, J., Zhang, Z., Miller, W., Lipman, D.J., Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: A new generation of protein database search programs (1997) Nucleic Acids Res, 25, pp. 3389-3402; Bateman, A., Birney, E., Durbin, R., Eddy, S.R., Finn, R.D., Sonnhammer, E.L., Pfam 3.1: 1313 multiple alignments and profile HMMs match the majority of proteins (1999) Nucleic Acids Res, 27, pp. 260-262; Berke, T., Matson, D.O., Reclassification of the Caliciviridae into distinct genera and exclusion of hepatitis E virus from the family on the basis of comparative phylogenetic analysis (2000) Arch Virol, 145, pp. 1421-1436; Bradley, D.W., Balayan, M.S., Virus of enterically transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis (1988) Lancet, 1, p. 819; Brian, D.A., Hogue, B.G., Kienzle, T.E., The coronavirus hemagglutinin esterase glycoprotein (1995) The Coronaviridae, pp. 165-176. , Siddell SG (ed) Plenum press, New York; Brierley, I., Ribosomal frameshifting on viral RNAs (1995) J Gen Virol, 76, pp. 1885-1892; Cavanagh, D., The coronavirus surface glycoprotein (1995) The Coronaviridae, pp. 73-113. , Siddell SG (ed) Plenum press, New York; Cavanagh, D., Brian, D.A., Briton, M., Enjuanes, L., Holmes, K.V., Lai, M.M.C., Laude, H., Talbot, P., Revision of the taxonomy of the Coronavirus, Torovirus, and Arterivirus genera (1994) Arch Virol, 135, pp. 227-237; Cavanagh, D., Mawditt, K., Welchman, DdB., Britton, P., Gough, R.E., Coronaviruses from pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) are genetically closely related to coronaviruses of domestic fowl (infectious bronchitis virus) and turkeys (2002) Avian Pathol, 31, pp. 81-93; Chouljenko, V.N., Lin, X.Q., Kousoulas, K.G., Gorbalenya, A.E., Comparison of genomic and predicted amino acid sequences of respiratory and enteric bovine coronaviruses isolated from the same animal with fatal shipping pneumonia (2001) J Gen Virol, 82, pp. 2927-2933; Cornelissen, L.A.H.M., Wierda, C.M.H., Van Der Meer, F.J., Herrewegh, A.P.M., Horzinek, M.C., Egberonk, H.F., Groot, R.J., Hemagglutinin-esterase, a novel structural protein of torovirus (1997) J Virol, 71, pp. 5277-5286; Cowley, J.A., Dimmock, C.M., Spann, K.M., Walker, P.J., Gill-associated virus of Penaeus monodon prawns: An invertebrate virus with ORF1a and ORF1b genes related to arteri-and coronaviruses (2000) J Gen Virol, 81, pp. 1473-1484; Cowley, J.A., Dimmock, C.M., Walker, P.J., Gill-associated nidovirus of Penaeus monodon prawns transcribes 3′-coterminal subgenomic mRNAs that do not possess 5′-leader sequences (2002) J Gen Virol, 83, pp. 927-935; Cowley, J.A., Walker, P.J., The complete genome sequence of gill-associated virus of Penaeus monodon prawns indicates a gene organisation unique among nidoviruses (2002) Arch Virol, 147, pp. 1977-1987; De Vries, A.A.F., Horzinek, M.C., Rottier, P.J.M., De Groot, R.J., The genome organization of the Nidovirales: Similarities and differences between arteri-, toro-, and coronaviruses (1997) Semin Virol, 8, pp. 33-47; Den Boon, J.A., Snijder, E.J., Chirnside, E.D., De Vries, A.A.F., Horzinek, M.C., Spaan, W.J.M., Equine arteritis virus is not a togavirus but belongs to the coronaviruslike superfamily (1991) J Virol, 65, pp. 2910-2920; Den Boon, J.A., Snijder, E.J., Locker, J.K., Horzinek, M.C., Rottier, J.M., Another triple-spanning envelope protein among intracellularly budding RNA viruses: The torovirus e protein (1991) Virology, 182, pp. 655-663; Doolittle, R.F., (1986) Of URFs and ORFs: A Primer on How to Analyze Derived Amino Acid Sequences, , University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA; Duckmanton, L., Luan, B., Devinish, J., Tellier, R., Petric, M., Characterization of torovirus from human fecal specimens (1997) Virology, 239, pp. 158-168; Enjuanes, L., Brian, D., Cavanagh, D., Holmes, K., Lai, M.M.C., Laude, H., Masters, P., Talbot, P., Coronaviridae (2000) Virus Taxonomy.

The genomic sequence relationship of SARS-CoV with 30 different single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses of various families was studied using two non-standard approaches. Both approaches began with the vectorial profiling of the tetra-nucleotide usage pattern V for each virus. In approach one, a distance measure of a vector V, based on correlation coefficient was devised to construct a relationship tree by the neighbor-joining algorithm. In approach two, a multivariate factor analysis was performed to derive the embedded tetra-nucleotide usage patterns. These patterns were subsequently used to classify the selected viruses. Results: Both approaches yielded relationship outcomes that are consistent with the known virus classification. They also indicated that the genome of RNA viruses from the same family conform to a specific pattern of word usage. Based on the correlation of the overall tetra-nucleotide usage patterns, the Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGV) and the Feline CoronaVirus (FCoV) are closest to SARS-CoV. Surprisingly also, the RNA viruses that do not go through a DNA stage displayed a remarkable discrimination against the CpG and UpA di-nucleotide (z = -77.31, -52.48 respectively) and selection for UpG and CpA (z = 65.79,49.99 respectively). Potential factors influencing these biases are discussed. Conclusion: The study of genomic word usage is a powerful method to classify RNA viruses. The congruence of the relationship outcomes with the known classification indicates that there exist phylogenetic signals in the tetra-nucleotide usage patterns, that is most prominent in the replicase open reading frames. © 2003 Yap et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Convergent evolution; Factor analysis; Horizontal gene transfer; RNA virus; SARS","nucleotide; virus DNA; virus RNA; virus vector; microsatellite DNA; virus RNA; article; classification; computer program; computer system; controlled study; correlation coefficient; gene expression profiling; gene sequence; genetic algorithm; genome analysis; mathematical computing; multivariate analysis; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; open reading frame; phylogeny; RNA virus; SARS coronavirus; Transmissible gastroenteritis virus; virus virulence; algorithm; animal; biosynthesis; Calicivirus; cattle; comparative study; Coronavirus; dinucleotide repeat; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; human; methodology; pathogenicity; rabbit; statistics; virus genome; Coronavirus; Felidae; Feline coronavirus; RNA viruses; Transmissible gastroenteritis virus; Algorithms; Animals; Cattle; Coronavirus 229E, Human; Coronavirus, Bovine; Dinucleotide Repeats; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Viral; Genome, Viral; Hemorrhagic Disease Virus, Rabbit; Humans; Microsatellite Repeats; Multivariate Analysis; Open Reading Frames; Phylogeny; Rabbits; RNA Viruses; RNA, Viral; SARS Virus","GENBANK: AY204704, NC_001451, NC_001543, NC_001846, NC_001924, NC_001961, NC_002031, NC_002032, NC_002058, NC_002306, NC_002532, NC_002534, NC_002554, NC_002645, NC_003045, NC_003092, NC_003436, NC_003990, NC_003996, NC_004718","RNA, Viral",,,,,,,,"Cumulative Number of Reported Probable Cases of SARS http://www.who.int/csr/sarscountry/en; Fouchier, R.A., Kuiken, T., Schutten, M., Van Amerongen, G., Van Doornum, G.J., Van Den Hoogen, B.G., Peiris, M., Osterhaus, A.D., Aetiology: Koch's postulates fulfilled for SARS virus (2003) Nature, 423 (6937), p. 240; Hoey, J., Maskalyk, J., SARS update (2003) CMAJ, 168 (10), pp. 1294-1295; James, J.S., SARS Web information (2003) AIDS Treat.

It is caused by the infection with a coronavirus, a single strand RNA capsulated virus, recently found in a small mammalian, the masked palm civet. It is likely to represent the source of human infection. The first cases of SARS have been reported in the Chinese province of Guangdong and, since then, probable cases have been reported world wide. The clinical picture is characterized by nonspecific symptoms such as fever, cough or dyspnea in patients affected by air-space opacities (unifocal involvement in the 54.6% of cases) or distress respiratory syndrome and linked to a recent exposure to a SARS case or to a travel/residence in an affected area. The empirical therapy is based on broad-spectrum antibiotics, steroids and ribavirin, but susceptibility testing have failed to demonstrate direct anti-viral activity of ribavirin against SARS-related coronavirus in vitro. The exposure to respiratory droplets and the contact with biologic fluids (respiratory and gastrointestinal secretions) represent the most efficient transmission modality of the SARS-related coronavirus. Hand hygiene is the most simple and cost effective measure of infection control to prevent contagion, and the use of airborne, contact and droplet precaution is strictly recommended to all health care workers taking care of such patients. The spread of SARS, to less developed country with limited resource for public health programs, represent the emerging alarming threat in the new global scenario.","Antibiotics; Coronavirus; Infectious diseases; Ribavirin; Severe acute respiratory syndrome; Steroids","antibiotic agent; ribavirin; steroid; antibiotic therapy; antiviral activity; China; Coronavirus; coughing; developing country; disease transmission; dyspnea; epidemic; fever; human; hygiene; infection control; mammal; masked palm civet; respiratory distress syndrome; review; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; symptomatology; travel; virus pneumonia; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Antiviral Agents; China; Hong Kong; Humans; Middle Aged; Ribavirin; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Time Factors; Travel; World Health; World Health Organization",,"ribavirin, 36791-04-5; Antiviral Agents; Ribavirin, 36791-04-5",,,,,,,,"Petersdorf, R.G., Adams, R.D., Braunwald, R., Isselbacher, K.J., Martin, J.B., Wilson, J.D., (1983) Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine. 10th Ed., , New York: McGraw-Hill; Krause, R.M., (1998) Emerging Infections.

In order to identify linear antigenic determinants, the primary structure of the S glycoprotein of murine hepatitis virus strain A59 was analyzed with a combination of nine epitope prediction algorithms. Fifteen potential epitopes were synthesized chemically and injected into BALB/c mice to study their biological relevance. This approach failed to identify novel important epitopes. Furthermore, the algorithms were unable to identify as antigenic the previously mapped immunodominant epitope A [C Daniel, R. Anderson, M. J. Buchmeier, J. O. Fleming, W. J. M. Spaan, H. Wege, and Talbot, P. J. (1993) J. Virol. 67, 1185-1194]. Interestingly, peptide A coupled to KLH induced an immune response that stimulated the immune response induced by the corresponding region of the protein much more accurately than when the same peptide was coupled to BSA. This included drastically enhanced competition with monoclonal antibodies and protection from virus challenge. These findings emphasize the shortcomings of amino acid sequence-based epitope prediction algorithms and demonstrate the critical importance of the carrier when synthetic peptides are considered as potential vaccines. © 1994 Academic Press.

As found with other coronaviruses, the peplomer protein carries the epitopes eliciting neutralizing antibodies. The gene encodes a primary translation product of 1162 amino acids with a molecular weight of 128079. The use of a recent algorithm to predict membrane-protein interactions led to the unambiguous localization of the signah peptide and a transmembrane anchor α-helix at the C-terminus. At 50 positions amino acid differences were found between M41 and two Beaudette strains (M42-Salk and M42-Houghton). They are partly clustered in two regions of the protein. These two regions are candidates for neutralization epitopes of the protein. © 1986.","coronavirus IBV; M42; peplomer protein; strain M41","complementary dna; epitope; neutralizing antibody; radioisotope; virus antigen; virus protein; amino acid sequence; avian infectious bronchitis virus; gene sequence; genetic engineering; heredity; molecular cloning; nonhuman; peplomer; priority journal; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Coronaviridae; DNA; Epitopes; Genes; Genes, Viral; Infectious bronchitis virus; Protein Conformation; Species Specificity; Viral Envelope Proteins; Aves; Avian infectious bronchitis virus; Coronavirus","GENBANK: M21883","DNA, 9007-49-2; Epitopes; Viral Envelope Proteins",,,,,,,,"Belt, Carroll, Porter, The structural basis of the multiple forms of human complement component C4 (1984) Cell, 36, pp. 907-914; Binns, Boursnell, Cavanagh, Pappin, Brown, Cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding the spike protein of the coronavirus IBV (1985) J.
