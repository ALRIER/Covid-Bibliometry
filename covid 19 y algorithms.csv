All types of industries, vehicle movement, and people's activity suddenly halted, perhaps for the first time in modern history. For a long time, it has been stated in various literature that the increased industrialization and anthropogenic activities in the last two decades polluted the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. Since the industries and people's activities have been shut off for a month or more in many parts of the world, it is expected to show some improvement in the prevailing conditions in the aforementioned spheres of environment. Here, with the help of remote sensing images, this work quantitatively demonstrated the improvement in surface water quality in terms of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the Vembanad Lake, the longest freshwater lake in India. The SPM estimated based on established turbidity algorithm from Landsat-8 OLI images showed that the SPM concentration during the lockdown period decreased by 15.9% on average (range: −10.3% to 36.4%, up to 8 mg/l decrease) compared with the pre-lockdown period. Time series analysis of satellite image collections (April 2013 – April 2020) showed that the SPM quantified for April 2020 is the lowest for 11 out of 20 zones of the Vembanad lake. When compared with preceding years, the percentage decrease in SPM for April 2020 is up to 34% from the previous minima. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Coronavirus; Surface water; Suspended particulate matter; Turbidity; Water quality","Lakes; Remote sensing; Time series analysis; Water quality; Anthropogenic activity; Fresh water lakes; Lake water quality; Remote sensing images; Satellite images; Suspended particulate matters; Vehicle movements; Vembanad lakes; Image enhancement; Coronavirus",,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS: 19 K04681","This work was partially supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI Grant Number 19 K04681.","Akimoto, H., Global air quality and pollution (2003) Science, 302, pp. 1716-1719; Balchand, A., Nair, S., Studies on the fractionation of phosphates in the sediments of a tropical water way (1994) Environ.

The ability to detect disease outbreaks in the early stages is a key component of efficient disease control and prevention. With the increased availability of electronic health-care data and spatial analysis techniques, there is great potential to develop algorithms to enable more effective disease surveillance. The research focuses to develop a transparent user-friendly method to simulate the outbreak data. The paper describes the GIS tools to identify and define the field of investigation which requires consideration of the strengths and limitations of data collection instruments, facility of locational data collection, accuracy of locational data, and pertinent attributes for understanding disease risk. Using such information, it is quite easy for authorities to locate the highly effected area and take appropriate actions in that particular areas. However, GIS techniques, resources, and methods can be used in Pakistan for more effective investigation of vulnerable geographical locations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; GIS; Health; Pakistan","Disease control; Geographic information systems; Location; Control and prevention; Disease outbreaks; Disease surveillance; Electronic healthcare; Geographical locations; Health emergencies; Pertinent attributes; User-friendly methods; Data acquisition; algorithm; COVID-19; disease control; disease prevalence; disease spread; GIS; health care; public health; respiratory disease; spatial analysis; viral disease; Pakistan; Coronavirus",,,,,,,"Ahmed, W., Angel, N., Edson, J., Bibby, K., Bivins, A., O'Brien, J.W., Choi, P.M., Mueller, J.F., First confirmed detection of SARS-CoV-2 in untreated wastewater in Australia: a proof of concept for the wastewater surveillance of COVID-19 in the community (2020) Sci.

The management of these patients is still evolving. Materials and methods: This is a single-center observational cohort study of critically ill patients infected with COVID-19. Bedside clinicians abstracted daily patient data on history, treatment, and short-term course. We describe management and a proposed severity scale for treatment used in this hospital. Results: 44 patients were enrolled; with incomplete information on 11. Of the 33 studied patients, 91% were male, median age 64; 88% were overweight or obese. 45% were hypertensive, 12% had been taking an ACE-inhibitor. Noninvasive ventilation was performed on 39% of patients for part or all or their ICU stay with no provider infection. Most patients received antibiotics for pneumonia. Patients also received lopinivir/ritonavir (82%), hydroxychloroquine (79%), and tocilizumab (12%) according to this treatment algorithm. Nine of 10 patients survived their ICU course and were transferred to the floor, with one dying in the ICU. Conclusions: ICU patients with COVID-19 frequently have hypertension. Many could be managed with noninvasive ventilation, despite the risk of aerosolization. The use of a severity scale augmented clinician management. © 2020 The Authors","COVID-19; Novel coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2","antibiotic agent; carbapenem; cephalosporin; dexamethasone; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; macrolide; oxygen; penicillin derivative; tocilizumab; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; anamnesis; Article; blood oxygen tension; Brescia Respiratory COVID Severity Scale; clinical article; clinical feature; cohort analysis; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; critically ill patient; disease severity; disease severity assessment; female; human; hypertension; intensive care unit; Italy; male; medical record; middle aged; mortality; noninvasive ventilation; obesity; observational study; patient care; patient transport; pneumonia; positive end expiratory pressure; SARS-related coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; survival rate; treatment outcome",,"carbapenem, 83200-96-8; cephalosporin, 11111-12-9; dexamethasone, 50-02-2; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; oxygen, 7782-44-7; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,"Medicine SoCC, United States resource availability for COVID-19 (2020), https://sccm.org/Blog/March-2020/United-States-Resource-Availability-for-COVID-19?_zs=jxpjd1&_zl=w9pb6; (2020), Intensiva SIdAAReT.

We report a new methodology, the Patient Information Based Algorithm (PIBA), for estimating the death rate of a disease in real-time using publicly available data collected during an outbreak. PIBA estimated the death rate based on data of the patients in Wuhan and then in other cities throughout China. The estimated days from hospital admission to death was 13 (standard deviation (SD), 6 days). The death rates based on PIBA were used to predict the daily numbers of deaths since the week of February 25, 2020, in China overall, Hubei province, Wuhan city, and the rest of the country except Hubei province. The death rate of COVID-19 ranges from 0.75% to 3% and may decrease in the future. The results showed that the real death numbers had fallen into the predicted ranges. In addition, using the preliminary data from China, the PIBA method was successfully used to estimate the death rate and predict the death numbers of the Korean population. In conclusion, PIBA can be used to efficiently estimate the death rate of a new infectious disease in real-time and to predict future deaths. The spread of 2019-nCoV and its case fatality rate may vary in regions with different climates and temperatures from Hubei and Wuhan. PIBA model can be built based on known information of early patients in different countries. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Death rate; Inpatient; Normal distribution; Prediction","Forecasting; Fatality rates; Hospital admissions; Hubei Province; Infectious disease; Patient information; Real-time estimation; Standard deviation; Wuhan cities; Population statistics; algorithm; COVID-19; disease spread; estimation method; infectious disease; mortality; prediction; real time; respiratory disease; algorithm; Article; case fatality rate; China; climate; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; hospital admission; hospitalization; human; intensive care unit; mortality rate; patient information based algorithm; prediction; priority journal; South Korea; temperature; China; Italy; South Korea; Coronavirus",,,,,"90DDUC0058

As of 8 April 2020, 22,073 infection cases of COVID-19 among healthcare workers from 52 countries had been reported to WHO. COVID-19 has strong infectivity, high transmission speeds, and causes serious infection among healthcare worker. Burns are an acute-care condition, and burn treatment needs to be initiated before COVID-19 infection status can be excluded. The key step to infection prevention is to identify risk points of infection exposure, strengthen the protection against those risk points, and formulate an appropriate diagnosis and treatment protocol. Following an in-depth study of the latest literature on COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment, we reviewed the protocols surrounding hospitalization of patients with extensive burns (area≥50 %) in our hospital from February 2009 to February 2019 and, in accordance with the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, developed an algorithm for protection during diagnosis and treatment of burns. Therefore, the aspects of medical protection and the diagnosis and treatment of burns appear to be particularly important during the prevention and control of the COVID-19. This algorithm was followed for 4 patients who received emergency treatment in February 2020 and were hospitalized. All healthcare worker were protected according to the three-tiered protective measures, and there was no nosocomial infection. During the COVID-19 epidemic, the early stages of emergency treatment for patients with extensive burns requiring the establishment of venous access for rehydration, endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy, wound treatment, and surgery are the risk points for exposure to infection. The implementation of effective, appropriate-grade protection and formulation of practical treatment protocols can increase protection of healthcare worke and reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection exposure. © 2020","Burns; COVID-19; Epidemic prevention and control; Exposure risk; Healthcare-associated infections; Protection","C reactive protein; D dimer; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; infusion fluid; muscle enzyme; myoglobin; procalcitonin; adolescent; adult; aged; burn; burn patient; central vein; child; coronavirus disease 2019; emergency treatment; endotracheal intubation; epidemic; female; fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction; gene sequence; general anesthesia; hand washing; health care personnel; hospitalization; human; immunoglobulin blood level; infant; infection control; infection prevention; major clinical study; male; middle aged; necrotizing fasciitis; newborn; occupational exposure; pleura effusion; priority journal; protein blood level; pulmonary hypertension; rehydration; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; susceptible population; thorax radiography; tracheostomy; very elderly; virus transmission; wound care",,"C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; immunoglobulin G, 97794-27-9; immunoglobulin M, 9007-85-6; procalcitonin, 56645-65-9",,,"A2017004, A2016108

According to the ACR guidelines issued shortly after this disease was declared a pandemic, radiologists are expected to familiarize themselves with the CT appearance of COVID-19 infection in order to be able to identify specific findings of this entity. This case report discusses the relevant imaging findings of one of the first cases in the mid-western United States. It involves a 60-year-old man who presented with fever, dyspnea, and cough for 1 week and subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. The utility of the noncontrast CT chest in the diagnosis of COVID-19 has been controversial, but there are specific imaging findings that have been increasingly associated with this virus in the appropriate clinical context. The stages of imaging findings in COVID-19 are considered along with the implications of fibrosis throughout the stages. Future considerations include using artificial intelligence algorithms to distinguish between community acquired pneumonias and COVID-19 infection. © 2020",,"remdesivir; adult; Article; assisted ventilation; case report; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; contrast enhancement; coronavirus disease 2019; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; disease course; dyspnea; extubation; fever; human; intensive care unit; isolation; lung fibrosis; male; middle aged; oxygen saturation; practice guideline; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thorax radiography; treatment response; United States",,"remdesivir, 1809249-37-3",,,,,"Cao, A.M., Choy, J.P., Mohanakrishnan, L.N., Bain, R.F., van Driel, M.L., Chest radiographs for acute lower respiratory tract infections (2013) Cochrane Database Sys Rev, (12). , https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6464822/; Holshue, M.L., DeBolt, C., Lindquist, S., Lofy, K.H., Wiesman, J., Bruce, H., (2020) N Engl J Med, 382, pp. 929-936. , https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191; Ai, T., Yang, Z., Hou, H., Zhan, C., Chen, C., Lv, W., Correlation of chest CT and RT-PCR testing in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China: a report of 1014 cases (2020) Radiology, , [Epub ahead of print]; Li, Y., Xia, L., Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): role of chest CT in diagnosis and management (2020) AJR Am J Roentgenol; (2020), www.acr.org/Advocacy-and-Economics/ACR-Position-Statements/Recommendations-for-Chest-Radiography-and-CT-for-Suspected-COVID19-Infection, “American College of Radiology, ACR recommendations for the use of chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) for suspected COVID-19 infection.” Am Coll Radiol; Kong, W., Agarwal, P., Chest imaging appearance of COVID-19 infection (2020) Radiol Cardiothorac Imaging, , https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/ryct.2020200028, (Epub ahead of print); Pan, F., Ye, T., Sun, P., Gui, S., Liang, B., Lingli, L., Time course of lung changes on chest CT during recovery from 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia (2020) Radiology, , Published online February 13; Bernheim, A., Mei, X., Huang, M., Yang, Y., Fayad, Z.A., Zhang, N., Chest CT findings in coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19): relationship to duration of infection (2020) Radiology; Collins, J., Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (2014) Chest radiology, the essentials, , Eric J Stern 3rd ed.

The collected data included 33 death cases in Wuhan city of Hubei province during early outbreak as well as confirmed cases and death toll in some specific regions, which were chosen as representatives from the perspective of the coronavirus outbreak in China. Data were copied and pasted onto Excel spreadsheets to perform data analysis. A new methodology, Patient Information Based Algorithm (PIBA) [1], has been adapted to process the data and used to estimate the death rate of COVID-19 in real-time. Assumption is that the number of days from inpatients to death fall into a pattern of normal distribution and the scores in normal distribution can be obtained by observing 33 death cases and analysing the data [2]. We selected 5 scores in normal distribution of these durations as lagging days, which will be used in the following estimation of death rate. We calculated each death rate on accumulative confirmed cases with each lagging day from the current data and then weighted every death rate with its corresponding possibility to obtain the total death rate on each day. While the trendline of these death rate curves meet the curve of current ratio between accumulative death cases and confirmed cases at some points in the near future, we considered that these intersections are within the range of real death rates. Six tables were presented to illustrate the PIBA method using data from China and South Korea.

Methods: The currently available literature was reviewed for microbiologically confirmed infections by 2019-nCoV or COVID-19 at the time of writing (13 February 2020). A literature search was performed using the PubMed database and Cochrane Library. Search terms included ‘novel coronavirus’ or ‘2019-nCoV’ or ‘COVID-19’. Results: Published cases occurred mostly in males (age range, 8–92 years). Cardiovascular, digestive and endocrine system diseases were commonly reported, except previous chronic pulmonary diseases [e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, bronchiectasis] that were surprisingly underreported. Fever was present in all of the case series available, flanked by cough, dyspnoea, myalgia and fatigue. Multiple bilateral lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation or bilateral ground-glass opacities were the main reported radiological features of 2019-nCoV infection, at least in the early phases of the disease. Conclusion: The new 2019-nCoV epidemic is mainly associated with respiratory disease and few extrapulmonary signs. However, there is a low rate of associated pre-existing respiratory co-morbidities. © 2020","2019-nCoV; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Outbreak; Pneumonia; SAR-CoV-2","abnormal laboratory result; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Article; asthma; bronchiectasis; cardiovascular disease; chronic lung disease; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; dyspnea; endocrine disease; epidemic; fever; gastrointestinal disease; heart injury; human; mortality; myalgia; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; thorax radiography",,,,,,,"Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Ren, L., Zhao, J., Hu, Y., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 497-506; https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases, Situation update worldwide; https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/locations-confirmed-cases.html, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

In the bioinformatics area, one of the crucial points is the analysis of the virus nucleotide sequences using approaches such as data stream, digital signal processing, and machine learning techniques and algorithms. However, to make feasible this approach, it is necessary to transform the nucleotide sequences string to numerical values representation. Thus, the dataset provides a chaos game representation (CGR) of SARS-CoV-2 virus nucleotide sequences. The dataset provides the CGR of 100 instances of SARS-CoV-2 virus, 11540 instances of other viruses from the Virus-Host DB dataset, and three instances of Riboviria viruses from NCBI (Betacoronavirus RaTG13, bat-SL-CoVZC45, and bat-SL-CoVZXC21). © 2020 The Author(s)","CGR; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2",,,,,,"CoordenaÃ§Ã£o de AperfeiÃ§oamento de Pessoal de NÃ­vel Superior, CAPES","The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support of the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) for their financial support.","(2020), https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/sars-cov-2-seqs/, NCBI, SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) Sequences (); Mihara, T., Nishimura, Y., Shimizu, Y., Nishiyama, H., Yoshikawa, G., Uehara, H., Hingamp, P., Ogata, H., Linking virus genomes with host taxonomy (2016) Viruses, 8 (3); Virus-Host, D.B., (2020), https://www.genome.jp/virushostdb, Virus-Host DB - Website (); Randhawa, G.S., Soltysiak, M.P., Roz, H.E., de Souza, C.P., Hill, K.A., Kari, L., Machine learning using intrinsic genomic signatures for rapid classification of novel pathogens: Covid-19 case study (2020) bioRxiv; Randhawa, G.S., Soltysiak, M.P., Roz, H.E., de Souza, C.P., Hill, K.A., Kari, L., Machine learning-based analysis of genomes suggests associations between wuhan 2019-ncov and bat betacoronaviruses (2020) bioRxiv; (2020), https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/, NCBI, Genbank (); Jeffrey, H., Chaos game representation of gene structure (1990) Nucleic Acids Research, 18 (8), pp. 2163-2170; Yin, C., (2017), Encoding DNA sequences by integer chaos game representation. arXiv preprint arXiv:; Hoang, T., Yin, C., Yau, S.S.-T., Numerical encoding of dna sequences by chaos game representation with application in similarity comparison (2016) Genomics, 108 (3), pp. 134-142","Fernandes, M.A.C.email: mfernandes@dca.ufrn.br",,,"Elsevier Inc.",,,,,23523409,,,,"English","Data Brief",Data Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083888161

However, traditional SPM neglects the pattern repetition in sequence. To solve this problem, gap constraint SPM was proposed and can avoid finding too many useless patterns. Nonoverlapping SPM, as a branch of gap constraint SPM, means that any two occurrences cannot use the same sequence letter in the same position as the occurrences. Nonoverlapping SPM can make a balance between efficiency and completeness. The frequent patterns discovered by existing methods normally contain redundant patterns. To reduce redundant patterns and improve the mining performance, this paper adopts the closed pattern mining strategy and proposes a complete algorithm, named Nettree for Nonoverlapping Closed Sequential Pattern (NetNCSP) based on the Nettree structure. NetNCSP is equipped with two key steps, support calculation and closeness determination. A backtracking strategy is employed to calculate the nonoverlapping support of a pattern on the corresponding Nettree, which reduces the time complexity. This paper also proposes three kinds of pruning strategies, inheriting, predicting, and determining. These pruning strategies are able to find the redundant patterns effectively since the strategies can predict the frequency and closeness of the patterns before the generation of the candidate patterns. Experimental results show that NetNCSP is not only more efficient but can also discover more closed patterns with good compressibility. Furtherly, in biological experiments NetNCSP mines the closed patterns in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS viruses. The results show that the two viruses are of similar pattern composition with different combinations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Closed pattern mining; COVID-19; Nettree; Nonoverlapping sequence pattern; Periodic wildcard gaps; Sequential pattern mining","Viruses; Closed pattern; COVID-19; Nettree; Nonoverlapping sequence; Periodic wildcard gaps; Sequential-pattern mining; Data mining",,,,,"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program): 2016YFB1000901

Material and method: Recommendations based on the consensus conference model. Results: In the case of a COVID-19 positive patient, surgical management should be postponed for at least 15 days. For cervical cancer, the place of surgery must be re-evaluated in relation to radiotherapy and Radio-Chemotherapy-Concomitant and the value of lymph node staging surgeries must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. For advanced ovarian cancers, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy should be favored even if primary cytoreduction surgery could be envisaged. It is lawful not to offer hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during a COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of patients who must undergo interval surgery, it is possible to continue the chemotherapy and to offer surgery after 6 cycles of chemotherapy. For early stage endometrial cancer, in case of low and intermediate preoperative ESMO risk, hysterectomy with bilateral annexectomy associated with a sentinel lymph node procedure should be favored. It is possible to consider postponing surgery for 1 to 2 months in low-risk endometrial cancers (FIGO Ia stage on MRI and grade 1-2 endometrioid cancer on endometrial biopsy). For high ESMO risk, it ispossible to favor the MSKCC algorithm (combining PET-CT and sentinel lymph node biopsy) in order to omit pelvic and lumbar-aortic lymphadenectomies. Conclusion: During COVID-19 pandemic, patients suffering from cancer should not lose life chance, while limiting the risks associated with the virus. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","COVID-19; Guideline; Gynaecological cancer; Management","antineoplastic agent; adjuvant therapy; advanced cancer; Article; bilateral annexectomy; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer staging; cancer surgery; chemoradiotherapy; consensus; coronavirus disease 2019; cytoreductive surgery; early cancer; endometrium cancer; female; female genital tract cancer; gynecologic surgery; human; hysterectomy; low risk patient; lumbar lymph node; lymph node; multiple cycle treatment; neoadjuvant chemotherapy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; ovary cancer; pandemic; paraaortic lymph node; pelvis lymphadenectomy; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; practice guideline; sentinel lymph node; sentinel lymph node biopsy; uterine cervix cancer",,,,,,,,"Lavoue, V.; Service de gynécologie, CHU hôpital Sud, 16, boulevard de Bulgarie, France; email: Vincent.lavoue@gmail.com",,,"Elsevier Masson SAS",,,,,24687197,,,"32222433","English; French","Gynecol.

This gap will increase with the current pandemic due to COVID-19. AIM: To evaluate the current availability of digital health tools for the care of people with epilepsy according to the world medical literature and their use during said pandemic. DEVELOPMENT: We reviewed the publications in scientific journals in the last decade that had as their main topic the use of digital health tools or telemedicine focused on the care of patients with epilepsy, including 4 months after the national quarantines due to the appearance of the virus SARS-CoV-2. Seventeen publications were found on the use of telemedicine focused on epilepsy. The most widely used tools internationally are online platforms, followed by mobile applications, videoconferences, epileptic seizure capture systems, checklists, algorithms for understanding medical data, phone calls, tele-encephalography and text messages. None was published during the COVID-19 current pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is little literature on the use of digital health tools focused on epilepsy, there are several that can be used to fight the attention gap, especially in this global pandemic by COVID-19 that forces quarantines of people and communities for long periods. It is necessary to remove barriers and facilitate patient access to these new information technologies.TITLE: Herramientas de salud digital para superar la brecha de atención en epilepsia antes, durante y después de la pandemia de COVID-19. Introducción. La epilepsia es un trastorno neurológico crónico común que afecta alrededor de 50 millones de personas en el mundo y abunda la bibliografía sobre la brecha de atención en salud a este sector de la población. Dicha brecha aumentará con la pandemia actual de COVID-19. Objetivo. Evaluar la disponibilidad actual de herramientas de salud digital para la atención a personas con epilepsia según la literatura médica mundial y su uso durante dicha pandemia. Desarrollo. Se hizo una revisión de las publicaciones en revistas científicas en la última década que tuvieran como tema principal el uso de herramientas de salud digital o telemedicina enfocada a la atención de los pacientes con epilepsia, incluyendo cuatro meses después de las cuarentenas nacionales por la aparición del virus SARS-CoV-2. Se encontraron 17 publicaciones sobre el uso de telemedicina enfocada a la epilepsia. Las herramientas más utilizadas internacionalmente son las plataformas en línea, seguidas de las aplicaciones móviles, videoconferencias, sistemas de captación de crisis epilépticas, listas de verificación, algoritmos de comprensión de datos médicos, llamadas telefónicas, telelectroencefalografía y mensajes de texto. Ninguna se publicó durante la presente pandemia. Conclusiones. Hay poca bibliografía sobre herramientas de salud digital enfocadas a epilepsia, pero existen varias que pueden emplearse para luchar contra la brecha de atención, especialmente en esta pandemia mundial de COVID-19 que obliga a las personas y comunidades a mantenerse en cuarentena por la emergencia sanitaria. Es necesario eliminar barreras y facilitar el pronto acceso de los pacientes a estas nuevas tecnologías de información.",,"Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; epilepsy; health care delivery; human; mobile application; pandemic; patient care; procedures; quarantine; telemedicine; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Epilepsy; Humans; Mobile Applications; Pandemics; Patient Care; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine; Telemedicine",,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,15766578,,,"32329045","Spanish","Rev Neurol",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084031165

Beside clinical procedures and treatments, since Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises a new paradigm for healthcare, several different AI tools that are built upon Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed for analyzing data and decision-making processes. This means that AI-driven tools help identify COVID-19 outbreaks as well as forecast their nature of spread across the globe. However, unlike other healthcare issues, for COVID-19, to detect COVID-19, AI-driven tools are expected to have active learning-based cross-population train/test models that employs multitudinal and multimodal data, which is the primary purpose of the paper. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Active learning; Artificial intelligence; COVID-19; Cross-population train/test models; Machine learning; Multitudinal and multimodal data","active learning; Article; artificial intelligence; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; cross population train; data analysis; epidemic; human; machine learning; medical informatics; nonhuman; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus detection; virus diagnosis; virus pneumonia; algorithm; Coronavirus infection; decision making; epidemic; forecasting; health care delivery; virus pneumonia; COVID-19; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Coronavirus Infections; Decision Making; Delivery of Health Care; Disease Outbreaks; Forecasting; Humans; Machine Learning; Pneumonia, Viral",,"COVID-19",,,,,"Wu, F., Zhao, S., Yu, B., Chen, Y.M., Wang, W., Song, Z.G., Hu, Y., Zhang, Y.Z., A new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in china (2020) Nature, 44 (59), pp. 265-269; (2020) Public Health Response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak – United States, , February 24; Chen, N., Zhou, M., Dong, X., Qu, J., Gong, F., Han, Y., Qiu, Y., Zhang, L., Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in wuhan, china: A descriptive study (2020) The Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 507-513. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/; (2020) Report, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation Report – 49, , https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200229-sitrep-40-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=849d0665_2, accessed March 09, 2020; Wu, Z., McGoogan, J.M., Characteristics of and important lessons from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: Summary of a report of 72,314 cases from the Chinese center for disease control and prevention (2020) JAMA; (2020) The WHO Declares Public Health Emergency for Novel Coronavirus, , https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/924596, January 30; Long, J.B., Ehrenfeld, J.M., The role of augmented intelligence (ai) in detecting and preventing the spread of novel coronavirus (2020) Journal of Medical Systems, 44; Paules, C.I., Marston, H.D., Fauci, A.S., Coronavirus infections – more than just the common cold (2020) JAMA, 323 (8), pp. 707-708; Drosten, C., Gunther, S., Identification of a novel corona virus in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003) N Engl J Med, 348, pp. 1967-1976; Peiris, J., Lai, S., Poon, L., Guan, Y., Yam, L., Lim, W., Nicholls, J., Yuen, K., Coronavirus as a possible cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003) The Lancet, 361 (9366); Song, Z., Xu, Y., Bao, L., Zhang, L., Yu, P., Qu, Y., Zhu, H., Qin, C., From sars to mers, thrusting coronaviruses into the spotlight (2019) Viruses, 11 (1). , https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/11/1/59; de Wit, E., van Doremalen, N., Falzarano, D., Munster, V.J., Sarsandmers: Recentinsights into emerging coronaviruses (2016) Nature Reviews Microbiology, 14 (8), pp. 523-534; Sammut, C., Webb, G.I., (2017) Encyclopedia of Machine Learning and Data Mining, , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4899-7687-1, Springer; Chen, J., Wu, L., Zhang, J., Zhang, L., Gong, D., Zhao, Y., Hu, S., Yu, H., (2020) Deep Learning-Based Model for Detecting 2019 Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia on High-Resolution Computed Tomography: A Prospective Study.

Non-invasive monitoring is also extremely necessary in situations where it is difficult to use complicated wired connections, such as ECG monitoring for infants, burn victims or during rescue missions when people are buried during building collapses/earthquakes. Due to the unique characteristics such as higher penetration capabilities, extremely precise ranging, low power requirement, low cost, simple hardware and robustness to multipath interferences, Impulse Radio Ultra Wideband (IR-UWB) technology is appropriate for non-invasive medical applications. IR-UWB sensors detect the macro as well as micro movement inside the human body due to its fine range resolution. The two vital signs, i.e., respiration rate and heart rate, can be measured by IR-UWB radar by measuring the change in the magnitude of signal due to displacement caused by human lungs, heart during respiration and heart beating. This paper reviews recent advances in IR- UWB radar sensor design for healthcare, such as vital signs measurements of a stationary human, vitals of a non-stationary human, vital signs of people in a vehicle, through the wall vitals measurement, neonate's health monitoring, fall detection, sleep monitoring and medical imaging. Although we have covered many topics related to health monitoring using IR-UWB, this paper is mainly focused on signal processing techniques for measurement of vital signs, i.e., respiration and heart rate monitoring.","algorithm; fall detection; heart rate; IR-UWB radar; motion detection; respiration rate; sleep monitoring; vital signs","breathing rate; Coronavirus infection; devices; heart rate; human; pandemic; physiologic monitoring; procedures; radiofrequency radiation; signal processing; telecommunication; telemedicine; theoretical model; virus pneumonia; Coronavirus Infections; Heart Rate; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Monitoring, Physiologic; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Radar; Radio Waves; Respiratory Rate; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Telemedicine",,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,14248220,,,"32349382","English","Sensors (Basel)",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084170606

This study aims to evaluate the knowledge of anesthesiology specialists and residents in Turkey about COVID-19 and their attitudes toward the strategies and application methods to be used for a suspected/confirmed COVID-19 case that needs to be operated on or followed up in an intensive care unit, as well as to raise awareness about this issue. Methods: This descriptive study comprised anesthesiology specialists and residents working in various health institutions in Turkey. The data used in this study were obtained online between March 13, 2020 and March 25, 2020 through the website SurveyMonkey (SurveyMonkey, San Mateo, CA) by using a survey form. We contacted members of the Turkish Anaesthesiology and Reanimation Society through the social media platforms Twitter, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp, as well as through their e-mail addresses and invited them to participate in the study. Those who agreed to participate responded to the aforementioned survey. We used SPSS 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY) to analyze the survey data statistically. Results: A total of 346 anesthesiology specialists and residents participated in the study. Although the majority of the participants exhibited the correct attitudes toward airway management, research assistants with little professional experience were observed to be undecided or had the tendency to make incorrect decisions. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly worldwide. The incidence of COVID-19 cases is increasing daily, and this disease can cause patient death. Anesthesiology specialists and residents who perform emergency operations on these patients in settings other than intensive care units should follow simple and easy-to-understand algorithms to ensure safety. The provision of theoretical and practical training to healthcare providers before they meet patients will help ensure patient-healthcare provider safety and prevent panic, which can cause distress among healthcare providers.","anesthesiology; COVID-19; intensive care",,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,15578674,,,"32275463","English","Surg Infect (Larchmt)",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083865804

Nowadays, social media has become the main channel through which the public can obtain information and express their opinions and feelings. This study explored public opinion in the early stages of COVID-19 in China by analyzing Sina-Weibo (a Twitter-like microblogging system in China) texts in terms of space, time, and content. Temporal changes within one-hour intervals and the spatial distribution of COVID-19-related Weibo texts were analyzed. Based on the latent Dirichlet allocation model and the random forest algorithm, a topic extraction and classification model was developed to hierarchically identify seven COVID-19-relevant topics and 13 sub-topics from Weibo texts. The results indicate that the number of Weibo texts varied over time for different topics and sub-topics corresponding with the different developmental stages of the event. The spatial distribution of COVID-19-relevant Weibo was mainly concentrated in Wuhan, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration. There is a synchronization between frequent daily discussions on Weibo and the trend of the COVID-19 outbreak in the real world. Public response is very sensitive to the epidemic and significant social events, especially in urban agglomerations with convenient transportation and a large population. The timely dissemination and updating of epidemic-related information and the popularization of such information by the government can contribute to stabilizing public sentiments. However, the surge of public demand and the hysteresis of social support demonstrated that the allocation of medical resources was under enormous pressure in the early stage of the epidemic. It is suggested that the government should strengthen the response in terms of public opinion and epidemic prevention and exert control in key epidemic areas, urban agglomerations, and transboundary areas at the province level. In controlling the crisis, accurate response countermeasures should be formulated following public help demands. The findings can help government and emergency agencies to better understand the public opinion and sentiments towards COVID-19, to accelerate emergency responses, and to support post-disaster management. © 2020 by the authors.

Our objective was to evaluate the reality and perceptions about personal safety among healthcare workers in Latin America. This is a cross-sectional, online survey-based study administered to 936 healthcare professionals in Latin America from 31 March 2020 to 4 April 2020. A 12-item structured questionnaire was developed. A total of 936 healthcare workers completed the online survey. Of them, 899 (95.1%) were physicians, 28 (2.9%) were nurses, and 18 (1.9%) were allied health professionals. Access to protective equipment was as follows: gel hand sanitizer (n = 889; 95%), disposable gloves (n = 853; 91.1%), disposable gowns (n = 630; 67.3%), disposable surgical masks (785; 83.9%), N95 masks (n = 516; 56.1%), and facial protective shields (n = 305; 32.6%). The vast majority (n = 707; 75.5%) had access to personal safety policies and procedures, and 699 (74.7%) participants had access to diagnostic algorithms. On a 1-to-10 Likert scale, the participants expressed limited human resources support (4.92 ± 0.2; mean ± SD), physical integrity protection in the workplace (5.5 ± 0.1; mean ± SD), and support from public health authorities (5.01 ± 0.12; mean ± SD). Healthcare workers in Latin America had limited access to essential PPE and support from healthcare authorities during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 by the authors.

In the context of the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the ability to deliver timely and efficacious care must be balanced with the risk of infectious exposure to the clinical team. Furthermore, rapid and effective stroke care remains paramount to achieve maximal functional recovery for those needing admission and to triage care appropriately for those who may be presenting with neurological symptoms but have an alternative diagnosis. Methods- Available resources, COVID-19-specific infection prevention and control recommendations, and expert consensus were used to identify clinical screening criteria for patients and provide the required nuanced considerations for the healthcare team, thereby modifying the conventional code stroke processes to achieve a protected designation. Results- A protected code stroke algorithm was developed. Features specific to prenotification and clinical status of the patient were used to define precode screening. These include primary infectious symptoms, clinical, and examination features. A focused framework was then developed with regard to a protected code stroke. We outline the specifics of personal protective equipment use and considerations thereof including aspects of crisis resource management impacting team role designation and human performance factors during a protected code stroke. Conclusions- We introduce the concept of a protected code stroke during a pandemic, as in the case of COVID-19, and provide a framework for key considerations including screening, personal protective equipment, and crisis resource management. These considerations and suggested algorithms can be utilized and adapted for local practice.","algorithms; consensus; COVID-19; pandemics; stroke",,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,15244628,,,"32233980","English","Stroke",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083250418

Typically, the individuals are scattered across different locations, and available quarantine vehicles are limited. Therefore, it is challenging to efficiently schedule the vehicles to transfer the individuals to isolated regions to control the spread of the epidemic. In this paper, we formulate such a quarantine vehicle scheduling problem for high-risk individual transfer, which is more difficult than most well-known vehicle routing problems. To efficiently solve this problem, we propose a hybrid algorithm based on the water wave optimization (WWO) metaheuristic and neighborhood search. The metaheuristic uses a small population to rapidly explore the solution space, and the neighborhood search uses a gradual strategy to improve the solution accuracy. Computational results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms several existing algorithms and obtains high-quality solutions on real-world problem instances for high-risk individual transfer in Hangzhou, China, during the peak period of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). © 2020 by the authors.

In these situations, the wireless networks may become congested or completely disrupted and may not be adequate to support the traffic generated by rescuers. It is also considered as the key tool in Corona Virus (COVID-19) battle. Moreover, the conventional approaches with fixed gateways may not work either, and this might lead to decoding errors due to the large distance between mobile nodes and the gateway. To avoid the decoding errors and improve the reliability of the messages, we propose to use intermediate Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to transfer messages from ground-based Long Range (LoRa) nodes to the remote base station (BS). Specifically, this UAV-enabled LoRa architecture is based on the ad hoc WiFi network, wherein, UAVs act as relays for the traffic generated between LoRa nodes and BS. To make the architecture more efficient, a distributed topology control algorithm is also proposed for UAVs. The algorithm is based on virtual spring forces and movement prediction technique that periodically updates the UAV topology to adapt to the movement of the ground-based LoRa nodes that move on the surface. The simulation results show the feasibility of the proposed approach for packet reception rate and average delay quality of service (QoS) metrics. It is observed that the mechanisms implemented in a UAV-enabled LoRa network effectively help to improve the packet reception rate with nominal buffer delays. © 2020 by the authors.

METHODS: This retrospective case-control study involves subjects (7 to 98 years) presenting at the designated national outbreak screening centre and tertiary care hospital in Singapore for SARS-CoV-2 testing from January 26 to February 16, 2020. COVID-19 status was confirmed by PCR testing of sputum, nasopharyngeal swabs or throat swabs. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and exposure-risk variables ascertainable at presentation were analyzed to develop an algorithm for estimating the risk of COVID-19. Model development used Akaike's information criterion in a stepwise fashion to build logistic regression models, which were then translated into prediction scores. Performance was measured using receiver operating characteristics curves, adjusting for over-confidence using leave-out-one cross validation. RESULTS: The study population included 788 subjects, of whom 54 (6.9%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 734 (93.1%) were SARS-CoV-2 negative. The median age was 34 years and 407 (51.7%) were female. Using leave-out-one cross validation, all the models incorporating clinical tests (Models 1, 2 and 3) performed well with areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.91, 0.88 and 0.88 respectively. In comparison, Model 4 had an AUC of 0.65. CONCLUSIONS: Rapidly ascertainable clinical and laboratory data could identify individuals at high risk of COVID-19 and enable prioritization of PCR-testing and containment efforts. Basic laboratory test results were crucial to prediction models. © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.

The number of confirmed cases is increasing daily and reached 34,598 on 8 February 2020. In the current study, we present a new forecasting model to estimate and forecast the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the upcoming ten days based on the previously confirmed cases recorded in China. The proposed model is an improved adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) using an enhanced flower pollination algorithm (FPA) by using the salp swarm algorithm (SSA). In general, SSA is employed to improve FPA to avoid its drawbacks (i.e., getting trapped at the local optima). The main idea of the proposed model, called FPASSA-ANFIS, is to improve the performance of ANFIS by determining the parameters of ANFIS using FPASSA. The FPASSA-ANFIS model is evaluated using theWorld Health Organization (WHO) official data of the outbreak of the COVID-19 to forecast the confirmed cases of the upcoming ten days. More so, the FPASSA-ANFIS model is compared to several existing models, and it showed better performance in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE), Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE), coefficient of determination (R2), and computing time. Furthermore, we tested the proposed model using two different datasets of weekly influenza confirmed cases in two countries, namely the USA and China. The outcomes also showed good performances. © 2020 by the authors.","adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS); COVID-19; flower pollination algorithm (FPA); forecasting; salp swarm algorithm (SSA)",,,,,,,,"Chen, Y., Liu, Q., Guo, D., Emerging coronaviruses: Genome structure, replication, and pathogenesis (2020) J.

There is no specific medicine available for treating the disease. Luckily, traditional Chinese medicine has played a positive role in the fighting against COVID-19. In this paper, We collected and sorted the prescriptions of modern Chinese medicine for COVID-19 released by national government, different provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, as well as online databases, such as CNKI, WanFang medical network, and VIP database. These prescriptions were combined with the inheritance of traditional Chinese medicine auxiliary V2.5, and the complex system entropy clustering method was used to determine the association rules and frequency of single drug and drug combination in the prescription. In the end, 96 effective prescriptions were included. Among them, the four properties were mainly concentrated in temperature, cold and level, the five tastes were mainly concentrated in bitter, hot and sweet, and the meridians were mainly concentrated in lung, stomach and spleen. The high-frequency drugs were Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Gypsum Fibrosum, etc., and the high-frequency combinations are Gypsum Fibrosum-Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Gypsum Fibrosum-Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Armeniacae Semen Amarum-Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, the core combinations are Lepidii Semen-Armeniacae Semen Amarum-Gypsum Fibrosum, Pogostemonis Herba-Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens-Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, Ophiopogonis Radix-Armeniacae Semen Amarum-Scutellariae Radix and so on. Form new prescriptions Lepidii Semen, Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Gypsum Fibrosum, Pogostemonis Herba, Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex. Ophiopogonis Radix, Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Scutellariae Radix, Schisandrae Sphenantherae Fructus, Panacis Quinquefolii Radix. From the medicinal properties to high-frequency drugs and new prescriptions, it could be seen that the overall treatment of COVID-19 by traditional Chinese medicine was to strengthen body resistance, eliminate pathogenic factors, and give attention to Qi and Yin.","2019-nCoV; association rules; clustering algorithm; coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19); data mining","herbaceous agent; Betacoronavirus; Chinese medicine; Coronavirus infection; data mining; human; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Data Mining; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Humans; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",,"Drugs, Chinese Herbal",,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,10015302,,,"32281332","Chinese","Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083316317

The first related death occurred on March 17, 2020. Preparedness for the pandemic has been ongoing before the first case was detected. The National Pandemic Plan was published in 2006. The Pandemic Influenza National Preparedness Plan was available after being updated in light of experiences gained during the 2009 Influenza A pandemic. Accordingly, Pandemic Coordination Boards and Operation Centers have been established on the national and provincial levels. This was an adaptable plan to the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). We formed teams to work on a 24/7 basis and established a Scientific Committee at the Public Health Emergency Operation Center within the General Directorate of Public Health. “COVID-19 Risk Assessment”, “COVID-19 Guideline” and “Case Report Form”, regulations of personal protective equipment along with need-based guidelines, treatment algorithms, brochures and related documents have been released. For the case-based follow-up, Public Health Management System (HSYS) is being used. PCR and rapid diagnostic kits are being used to analyze the samples at the central Microbiology Reference Laboratory and the authorized laboratories in several provinces. Various preventive measures were implemented including flight restrictions to certain countries, gradually expanded to suspending all flights and prohibiting the entry of foreign nationals, 14-day isolation and symptom monitoring for those that came from countries under risk. Persons with chronic diseases have been granted an administrative leave, on campus education at schools and activities of public rest and entertainment areas were temporarily suspended. The measures have been implemented for penitentiary institutions, dormitories, nursing homes, public transport and intercity buses, and also weekend curfews are implemented. In accordance with the pandemic plan, actions have been carried out with a multi-sectoral approach, and preventive measures have been implemented to cover the society as a whole. © TÜBİTAK.","Control; COVID-19; COVID-19 pandemic; Preventive measures","coronavirus disease 2019; epidemic; health care personnel; health service; human; hygiene; infection control; infection prevention; information; policy; practice guideline; public health; quarantine; Review; risk assessment; social distance; traffic and transport; Turkey (republic); virus transmission; workplace; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; health care policy; information dissemination; laboratory technique; pandemic; polymerase chain reaction; protective equipment; travel; turkey (bird); virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Guidelines as Topic; Health Policy; Humans; Information Dissemination; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Quarantine; Travel; Turkey",,,,,,,"(2019), https://hsgm.saglik.gov.tr/tr/bulasicihastaliklar-haberler/ulusal-pandemi-hazirlik-plani.html; (2006), https://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2006/08/20060823.htm; (2020) Similarities and Differences – COVID-19 and Influenza [Online], , https://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=15760:similarities-and-differences-covid-&lang=en; (2020) European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, p. 29. , Rapid Risk Assessment: Outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): increased transmission globally – fifth update; (2020), https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports; (2020), https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen; (2020), https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance; (2020), https://covid19bilgi.saglik.gov.tr/tr/; (2020) COVID-19 Algoritmalar [Online], , https://covid19bilgi.saglik.gov.tr/tr/algoritmalar","Özgüler, Z.Ö.; General Directorate of Public Health, Ministry of HealthTurkey; email: zeynepozgemd@gmail.com",,,"Turkiye Klinikleri",,,,,13000144,,TJMEE,"32304192","English","Turk.

COVID-19 has created havoc, and scientists and physicians are urged to test the efficiency and safety of drugs used to treat this disease. In such a pandemic situation, various steps have been taken by the government to control and prevent the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2). This pandemic situation has forced scientists to rework strategies to combat infectious diseases through drugs, treatment, and control measures. COVID-19 treatment requires both limiting viral multiplication and neutralizing tissue damage induced by an inappropriate immune reaction. Currently, various diagnostic kits to test for COVID-19 are available, and repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19 has shown to be clinically effective. As the global demand for diagnostics and therapeutics continues to rise, it is essential to rapidly develop various algorithms to successfully identify and contain the virus. This review discusses the updates on specimens/samples, recent efficient diagnostics, and therapeutic approaches to control the disease and repurposed drugs mainly focusing on chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma (CP). More research is required for further understanding of the influence of diagnostics and therapeutic approaches to develop vaccines and drugs for COVID-19.

The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Pharmacy Special Interest Group Steering Committee aims to provide pharmacy practice management recommendations for how to transition clinical HCT or cellular therapy pharmacy services using telemedicine capabilities in the inpatient and outpatient settings to maintain an equivalent level of clinical practice while minimizing viral spread in a high-risk, immunocompromised population. In addition, the Steering Committee offers clinical management recommendations for COVID-19 in HCT and cellular therapy recipients based on the rapidly developing literature. As the therapeutic and supportive care interventions for COVID-19 expand, collaboration with clinical pharmacy providers is critical to ensure safe administration in HCT recipients. Attention to drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and toxicity, particularly QTc prolongation, warrants close cardiac monitoring and potential cessation of concomitant QTc-prolonging agents. Expanded indications for hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab have already caused stress on the usual supply chain. Detailed prescribing algorithms, decision pathways, and specific patient population stock may be necessary. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged all members of the healthcare team, and we must continue to remain vigilant in providing pharmacy clinical services to one of the most high-risk patient populations while also remaining committed to providing compassionate and safe care for patients undergoing HCT and cellular therapies. © 2020 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","Cellular therapy; Coronavirus; COVID-19; HCT; Pharmacist; Pharmacy",,,,,,"Sanofi Genzyme, Genzyme Corp.

These model predictions have shown a wide range of variations. In our study, we demonstrate that nonidentifiability in model calibrations using the confirmed-case data is the main reason for such wide variations. Using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for model selection, we show that an SIR model performs much better than an SEIR model in representing the information contained in the confirmed-case data. This indicates that predictions using more complex models may not be more reliable compared to using a simpler model. We present our model predictions for the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan after the lockdown and quarantine of the city on January 23, 2020. We also report our results of modeling the impacts of the strict quarantine measures undertaken in the city after February 7 on the time course of the epidemic, and modeling the potential of a second outbreak after the return-to-work in the city. © 2020 The Authors","Bayesian inference; COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan; Model selection; Nonidentifiability; Peak time of epidemic; Quarantine; SIR and SEIR models","2019 novel coronavirus; algorithm; Article; basic reproduction number; Bayes theorem; China; coronavirus disease 2019; disease surveillance; disease transmission; epidemic; human; incidence; mathematical model; maximum likelihood method; model; population size; prediction; public health; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",,,,,"Canada Foundation for Innovation, CFI","Research of MYL is supported in part by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada and Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) .","Akaike, H., Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle (1973) Second international symposium on information theory, pp. 267-281. , Akademiai Kiado Budapest; Bai, Y., Yao, L., Wei, T., Presumed asymptomatic carrier transmission of COVID-19 (2020) Journal of the American Medical Association, , Published online February 21, 2020; Burnham, K., Anderson, D., Model selection and multimodel inference: A practical information-theoretic approach (2002), Springer-Verlag New York; Chen, M., Shao, Q., Ibrahim, J., Monte Carlo methods in bayesian computation (2000), Springer-Verlag New York; Chowell, G., Castillo-Chavez, C., Fenimore, P., Kribs-Zaleta, C., Model parameters and outbreak control for SARS (2004) Emerging Infectious Diseases, 10, pp. 1258-1263; Cyranoski, D., When will the coronavirus outbreak peak?

Materials and method: The FRANCOGYN group of the National College of French Gynecologists and Obstetricians (CNGOF) convened to develop recommendations based on the consensus conference model. Results: If a patient with a gynecologic cancer presents with COVID-19, surgical management should be postponed for at least 15 days. For cervical cancer, radiotherapy and concomitant radiochemotherapy could replace surgery as first-line treatment and the value of lymph node staging should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. For advanced ovarian cancers, neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be preferred over primary cytoreduction surgery. It is legitimate not to perform hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic. For patients who are scheduled to undergo interval surgery, chemotherapy can be continued and surgery performed after 6 cycles. For patients with early stage endometrial cancer of low and intermediate preoperative ESMO risk, hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy combined with a sentinel lymph node procedure is recommended. Surgery can be postponed for 1–2 months in low-risk endometrial cancers (FIGO Ia stage on MRI and grade 1–2 endometrioid cancer on endometrial biopsy). For patients of high ESMO risk, the MSKCC algorithm (combining PET-CT and sentinel lymph node biopsy) should be applied to avoid pelvic and lumbar-aortic lymphadenectomy. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, management of a patient with cancer should be adapted to limit the risks associated with the virus without incurring loss of chance. © 2020 The Author(s)","COVID-19; Guideline; Gynaecological cancer; Management",,,,,,,,,"Lavoue, V.; Service de gynécologie, Hôpital sud, 16 BD de Bulgarie, France; email: Vincent.lavoue@gmail.com",,,"Elsevier Masson SAS",,,,,24687847,,,"32247066","English","J.

For help to better planning of interventions, this study was conducted to forecast the number of daily new infected cases with COVID-19 for next thirty days in Iran. Methods: The information of observed Iranian new cases from 19th Feb to 30th Mar 2020 was used to predict the number of patients until 29th Apr. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Auto-Regressive Integrated Mov-ing Average (ARIMA) models were applied for prediction. The data was prepared from daily reports of Iran Ministry of Health and open datasets provided by the JOHN Hopkins. To compare models, dataset was sepa-rated into train and test sets. Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was the comparison criteria. Results: Both algorithms forecasted an exponential increase in number of newly infected patients. If the spreading pattern continues the same as before, the number of daily new cases would be 7872 and 9558 by 29th Apr, respectively by ANN and ARIMA. While Model comparison confirmed that ARIMA prediction was more accurate than ANN. Conclusion: COVID-19 is contagious disease, and has infected many people in Iran. Our results are an alarm for health policy planners and decision-makers, to make timely decisions, control the disease and provide the equipment needed. © 2020, Iranian Journal of Public Health.

Nevertheless, there are some predicted and unpredicted problems that epidemic diseases are real and complex problems. Hence, in this research work, a serious challenge in the sustainable development process was investigated using the classification of confirmed cases of COVID-19 (new version of Coronavirus) as one of the epidemic diseases. Hence, binary classification modeling was used by the group method of data handling (GMDH) type of neural network as one of the artificial intelligence methods. For this purpose, the Hubei province in China was selected as a case study to construct the proposed model, and some important factors, namely maximum, minimum, and average daily temperature, the density of a city, relative humidity, and wind speed, were considered as the input dataset, and the number of confirmed cases was selected as the output dataset for 30 days. The proposed binary classification model provides higher performance capacity in predicting the confirmed cases. In addition, regression analysis has been done and the trend of confirmed cases compared with the fluctuations of daily weather parameters (wind, humidity, and average temperature). The results demonstrated that the relative humidity and maximum daily temperature had the highest impact on the confirmed cases. The relative humidity in the main case study, with an average of 77.9%, affected positively, and maximum daily temperature, with an average of 15.4 ◦C, affected negatively, the confirmed cases. © 2020 by the authors.

We developed an institutional algorithm to protect operating room team members during the COVID-19 pandemic and rationally conserve personal protective equipment (PPE). Study Design: An interventional platform (operating room, interventional suite, and endoscopy) PPE taskforce was convened by the hospital and medical school leadership and tasked with developing a common algorithm for PPE use, to be used throughout the interventional platform. In conjunction with our infectious disease experts, we developed our guidelines based on potential patterns of spread, risk of exposure, and conservation of PPE. Results: A decision tree algorithm describing our institutional guidelines for precautions for operating room team members was created. This algorithm is based on urgency of operation, anticipated viral burden at the surgical site, opportunity for a procedure to aerosolize virus, and likelihood a patient could be infected based on symptoms and testing. Conclusions: Despite COVID-19 being a new threat, we have shown that by developing an easy-to-follow decision tree algorithm for the interventional platform teams, we can ensure optimal health care worker safety. © 2020 American College of Surgeons",,,,,,,,,"Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 497-506; Holshue, M.L., DeBolt, C., Lindquist, S., First case of 2019 novel coronavirus in the United States (2020) N Engl J Med, 382, pp. 929-936; CDC's recommendations for 30 day mitigation strategies for Santa Clara County, California, based on current situation with COVID-19 transmission and affected health care facilities (2020) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, , https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/Santa-Clara_Community_Mitigation.pdf, Available at: (Accessed 28 March 2020); Order of the Health Officer of the County of Santa Clara.

The current document based on available data and consensus opinion addresses appropriate catheterization laboratory preparedness for treating these patients, including procedure-room readiness to minimize external contamination, safe donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE) to eliminate risk to staff, and staffing algorithms to minimize exposure and maximize team availability.

A large proportion of positive patients require hospitalization, while 5-6% of them may need more aggressive therapies in intensive care. Most governments have recommended social separation and severe measures of prevention of further spreading of the epidemic. Because hemodialysis (HD) patients need to access hospital and dialysis center facilities 3 times a week, this category of patients requires special attention. In this editorial, we tried to summarize the experience of our centers that hopefully may contribute to help other centers and colleagues that are facing the coming wave of the epidemic. Special algorithms for COVID-19 spreading in the dialysis population, recommendations for isolation and preventive measures in positive HD patients, and finally directions to manage logistics and personnel are reported. These recommendations should be considered neither universal nor absolute. Instead, they require local adjustments based on geographic location, cultural and social environments, and level of available resources. © 2020 S.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the cancellation of many conferences, forcing the scientific community to explore online alternatives. Here, we report on our experiences of organizing an online neuroscience conference, neuromatch, that attracted some 3000 participants and featured two days of talks, debates, panel discussions, and one-on-one meetings facilitated by a matching algorithm. By offering most of the benefits of traditional conferences, several clear advantages, and with fewer of the downsides, we feel that online conferences have the potential to replace many legacy conferences. © 2020, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

Unfortunately, some patients who may be or presumptively or confirmed as infected with COVID-2019 may also require emergent surgical procedures. As such, given the high-risk for exposure of many healthcare workers involved the complex requirements for appropriate isolation must be adhered to. Case presentation: We present our experience with a 77-year-old who required emergency cardiac surgery for a presumed acute aortic syndrome in the setting of a presumed, and eventually confirmed, COVID-2019 infection. We outline the necessary steps to maintain strict isolation precautions to limit potential exposure to the surgical Team. Conclusions: We hereby provide our algorithm for emergent surgical procedures in critically-ill patients with presumptive or confirmed infection with COVID-2019. The insights from this case report can potentially be templated to other facilities in order to uphold high standards of infection prevention and patient safety in surgery during the current COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 The Author(s).","COVID-2019; Emergency surgery; Infection control; SARS-CoV-2",,,,,,,,"Dong, E., Du, H., Gardner, L., An interactive web-based dashboard to track COVID-19 in real time (2020) Lancet Infect Dis., , https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30120-1, Epub ahead of print; Wu, Z., McGoogan, J.M., Characteristics of and important lessons from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: Summary of a report of 72 314 cases from the Chinese center for disease control and prevention (2020) JAMA, , https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.2648, Epub ahead of print; Moriarty, L.F., Public health responses to COVID-19 outbreaks on cruise ships-worldwide, February-March 2020 (2020) MMWR, 69 (12), pp. 347-352; Chen, X., Shang, Y., Yao, S., Liu, R., Liu, H., Perioperative care provider's considerations in managing patients with the COVID-19 infections (2020) Transl Perioper Pain Med., 7, pp. 216-224; (2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/controlrecommendations.html, Accessed on 04/03; Stahel, P.F., How to risk-stratify elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic?

According to the latest report (18-February-2020), it has infected more than 72,000 people globally and led to deaths of more than 1,016 people in China. Methods: The 2019 novel coronavirus proteome was aligned to a curated database of viral immunogenic peptides. The immunogenicity of detected peptides and their binding potential to HLA alleles was predicted by immunogenicity predictive models and NetMHCpan 4.0. Results: We report in silico identification of a comprehensive list of immunogenic peptides that can be used as potential targets for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) vaccine development. First, we found 28 nCoV peptides identical to Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS CoV) that have previously been characterized immunogenic by T cell assays. Second, we identified 48 nCoV peptides having a high degree of similarity with immunogenic peptides deposited in The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). Lastly, we conducted a de novo search of 2019-nCoV 9-mer peptides that i) bind to common HLA alleles in Chinese and European population and ii) have T Cell Receptor (TCR) recognition potential by positional weight matrices and a recently developed immunogenicity algorithm, iPred, and identified in total 63 peptides with a high immunogenicity potential. Conclusions: Given the limited time and resources to develop vaccine and treatments for 2019-nCoV, our work provides a shortlist of candidates for experimental validation and thus can accelerate development pipeline.

In August 2014, our team developed and implemented an algorithm to triage suspected cases of Ebola virus disease in a midwestern United States emergency department and outpatient clinics based on patient travel history and symptoms. Here, we present the lessons learned and modifications to update the tool. Methods: Two strategies were developed and utilized to properly identify, isolate, and inform on patients with suspected highly hazardous communicable diseases: 1) a robust electronic symptom and travel screen with decision support tools in the electronic medical record, and 2) the availability of workflow protocols for Ebola virus disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) once a person under investigation is identified. After action reports provided opportunities to modify the algorithm and improve the identification and isolation processes. Results: Since our screening and travel electronic medical record inception 5 years ago, modifications changed iteratively to further enhance the screening process. Since 2018, staff have identified 5 patients at risk for MERS; in all cases, identification occurred during the check-in process. Exposure investigations in the emergency department decreased significantly after algorithm implementation in January 2019, from 30 in 2018 to 0 in 2019. Discussion: Although highly hazardous communicable diseases like Ebola virus disease and MERS are of concern due to their mortality rates and limited treatment options, these same concepts may be applied to the early identification and isolation of patients suspected of having more common communicable diseases like measles and influenza, emphasizing the importance of protocol-based screening in the healthcare environment. © 2020 Emergency Nurses Association","Communicable disease control/methods; Disease outbreaks/prevention and control; Ebola; Emergency service,hospital; Patient isolation",,,,,,,,"Ebola virus disease https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-virus-disease, Available at: Updated 2019.

Yet, the public sector's predicament is a tragic double bind: its obligations to protect citizens from potential algorithmic harms are at odds with the temptation to increase its own efficiency - or in other words - to govern algorithms, while governing by algorithms. Whether such dual role is even possible, has been a matter of debate, the challenge stemming from algorithms' intrinsic properties, that make them distinct from other digital solutions, long embraced by the governments, create externalities that rule-based programming lacks. As the pressures to deploy automated decision making systems in the public sector become prevalent, this paper aims to examine how the use of AI in the public sector in relation to existing data governance regimes and national regulatory practices can be intensifying existing power asymmetries. To this end, investigating the legal and policy instruments associated with the use of AI for strenghtening the immigration process control system in Canada; “optimising” the employment services” in Poland, and personalising the digital service experience in Finland, the paper advocates for the need of a common framework to evaluate the potential impact of the use of AI in the public sector. In this regard, it discusses the specific effects of automated decision support systems on public services and the growing expectations for governments to play a more prevalent role in the digital society and to ensure that the potential of technology is harnessed, while negative effects are controlled and possibly avoided. This is of particular importance in light of the current COVID-19 emergency crisis where AI and the underpinning regulatory framework of data ecosystems, have become crucial policy issues as more and more innovations are based on large scale data collections from digital devices, and the real-time accessibility of information and services, contact and relationships between institutions and citizens could strengthen – or undermine - trust in governance systems and democracy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Algorithmic accountability; Artificial intelligence; Automated decision making; Public sector innovation","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Computer programming; Decision support systems; Digital devices; Economics; Information services; Public policy; Real time systems; Automated decision making; Automated decision making systems; Governance systems; Immigration process; Intrinsic property; Policy instruments; Potential impacts; Regulatory frameworks; Decision making",,,,,"European Commission, EC","Work on this paper has been in part conducted under the contract CT-EX2018D339879-101 funded by the ISA 2 ELISE Action , and in support of the activities on AI for the public sector of the AI Watch, a joint initiative of DG CONNECT and the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre.","Arundel, A., Bloch, C., Ferguson, B., Advancing innovation in the public sector: Aligning innovation measurement with policy goals (2019) Research Policy; Wrapping up the Australian public sector innovation indicators (2017); Bavitz, T.C., Hessekiel, K., Algorithms and justice, medium, july 2018 (2018); Digital Europe 2030: Designing scenarios for ICT in future governance and policy making (2012) Government information quarterly, volume 29, supplement 1, january 2012, pp. S121-S131; Bloch, C., Bugge, M., Public sector innovation - from theory to measurement, structural change and economic dynamics (2013); Calo, R., Artificial intelligence policy: A primer and roadmap (2017); Rebooting regulation: Exploring the future of AI policy in Canada, may 2019, Canada (2019); Dave, K., (2019), Systemic algorithmic harms, data & society, may 31st; Dzindolet, M., The role of trust in automation reliance (2003) International Journal of Human-Computer Studies; Eubanks, V., Automating inequality: How high-tech tools profile, police, and punish the poor (2018), Martin's Press St; European union public sector innovation scoreboard 2013 (2013); General Data Protection Regulation on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC of 27 April 2016, (OJ L 119 4.5.2016) (2016); (2018) Artificial intelligence for Europe, 2018, p. 237. , COM (final); The digital economy and society Index (DESI) (2018); (2019) Data protection rules as a trust-enabler in the EU and beyond – taking stock s, 24.7.2019 COM, 2019, p. 374. , (final); Poland “initiative for polish industry 4.0 – the future industry platform”, february 2018 (2018); Ethics guidelines for trustworthy artificial intelligence, April 2019 (2019); Finland Government, Finland's age of artificial intelligence, Ministry of economic Affairs and employment (2017), https://www.tekoalyaika.fi/en/reports/finland-leading-the-way-into-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence/3-eleven-key-actions-ushering-finland-into-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence/, Available at:; Finland Government, Finnish AI Competences and how to make them stronger, March 2019 (2019); Finland Government, Implementation of the national AuroraAI programme, Ministry of finance, March 2019 (2019); Finland Government, Sustainable Europe, sustainable future - Finland's presidency programme, June 2019 (2019); Flyvbjerg, B., Five misunderstandings about case-study research, qualitative inquiry (2006); alGOVrithms.

Arancio, Lucca, 55100, Italy","In December 2019, an atypical pneumonia invaded the city of Wuhan, China, and the causative agent of this disease turned out to be a new coronavirus. In January 2020, the World Health Organization named the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV and subsequently it is referred to as SARS-CoV2 and the related disease as CoViD-19 (Lai et al., 2020). Very quickly, the epidemic led to a pandemic and it is now a worldwide emergency requiring the creation of new antiviral therapies and a related vaccine. The purpose of this article is to review and investigate further the molecular mechanism by which the SARS-CoV2 virus infection proceeds via the formation of a hetero-trimer between its protein S, the ACE2 receptor and the B0AT1 protein, which is the “entry receptor” for the infection process involving membrane fusion (Li et al., 2003). A reverse engineering process uses the formalism of the Hill function to represent the functions related to the dynamics of the biochemical interactions of the viral infection process. Then, using a logical evaluation of viral density that measures the rate at which the cells are hijacked by the virus (and they provide a place for the virus to replicate) and considering the “time delay” given by the interaction between cell and virus, the expected duration of the incubation period is predicted. The conclusion is that the density of the virus varies from the “exposure time” to the “interaction time” (virus-cells). This model can be used both to evaluate the infectious condition and to analyze the incubation period. Background: The ongoing threat of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2 pandemic is alarming and strategies for combating infection are highly desired. This RNA virus belongs to the β-coronavirus genus and is similar in some features to SARS-CoV. Currently, no vaccine or approved medical treatment is available. The complex dynamics of the rapid spread of this virus can be demonstrated with the aid of a computational framework. Methods: A mathematical model based on the principles of cell-virus interaction is developed in this manuscript. The amino acid sequence of S proein and its interaction with the ACE-2 protein is mimicked with the aid of Hill function. The mathematical model with delay is solved with the aid of numerical solvers and the parametric values are obtained with the help of MCMC algorithm. Results: A delay differential equation model is developed to demonstrate the dynamics of target cells, infected cells and the SARS-CoV2. The important parameters and coefficients are demonstrated with the aid of numerical computations. The resulting thresholds and forecasting may prove to be useful tools for future experimental studies and control strategies. Conclusions: From the analysis, I is concluded that control strategy via delay is a promising technique and the role of Hill function formalism in control strategies can be better interpreted in an inexpensive manner with the aid of a theoretical framework. © 2020","Dynamical analysis; Kinetic modelling; MCMC analysis; Monoclonal antibody; Numerical simulations; SARS-CoV2",,,,,,,,"Assiri, A., McGeer, A., Perl, T.M., Price, C.S., Al Rabeeah, A.A., Cummings, D.A., Alabdullatif, Z.N., Makhdoom, H., Hospital outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (2013) N.
