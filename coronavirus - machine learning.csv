We aim to review the role of AI as a decisive technology to analyze, prepare us for prevention and fight with COVID-19 (Coronavirus) and other pandemics. Methods: The rapid review of the literature is done on the database of Pubmed, Scopus and Google Scholar using the keyword of COVID-19 or Coronavirus and Artificial Intelligence or AI. Collected the latest information regarding AI for COVID-19, then analyzed the same to identify its possible application for this disease. Results: We have identified seven significant applications of AI for COVID-19 pandemic. This technology plays an important role to detect the cluster of cases and to predict where this virus will affect in future by collecting and analyzing all previous data. Conclusions: Healthcare organizations are in an urgent need for decision-making technologies to handle this virus and help them in getting proper suggestions in real-time to avoid its spread. AI works in a proficient way to mimic like human intelligence. It may also play a vital role in understanding and suggesting the development of a vaccine for COVID-19. This result-driven technology is used for proper screening, analyzing, prediction and tracking of current patients and likely future patients. The significant applications are applied to tracks data of confirmed, recovered and death cases. © 2020 Diabetes India","AI Applications; Artificial Intelligence (AI); Coronavirus; COVID-19; Pandemic","antivirus agent; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine; unclassified drug; virus vaccine; Article; artificial intelligence; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; data analysis; drug delivery system; early diagnosis; health care personnel; human; mortality; pandemic; priority journal; systematic review; workload",,,,,,,"Haleem, A., Javaid, M., Vaishya, Effects of COVID 19 pandemic in daily life (2020) Curr Med Res Pract; Bai, H.X., Hsieh, B., Xiong, Z., Halsey, K., Choi, J.W., Tran, T.M., Pan, I., Jiang, X.L., Performance of radiologists in differentiating COVID-19 from viral pneumonia on chest CT (2020) Radiology; Hu, Z., Ge, Q., Jin, L., Xiong, M., (2002), Artificial intelligence forecasting of COVID-19 in China. arXiv preprint arXiv07112. 2020 Feb 17; Ai, T., Yang, Z., Hou, H., Zhan, C., Chen, C., Lv, W., Tao, Q., Xia, L., Correlation of chest CT and RT-PCR testing in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China: a report of 1014 cases (2020) Radiology; Luo, H., Tang, Q.L., Shang, Y.X., Liang, S.B., Yang, M., Robinson, N., Liu, J.P., Can Chinese medicine be used for prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?

Although a laboratory test is the current routine diagnostic tool, it is time-consuming, imposing a high cost and requiring a well-equipped laboratory for analysis. Computed tomography (CT) has thus far become a fast method to diagnose patients with COVID-19. However, the performance of radiologists in diagnosis of COVID-19 was moderate. Accordingly, additional investigations are needed to improve the performance in diagnosing COVID-19. In this study is suggested a rapid and valid method for COVID-19 diagnosis using an artificial intelligence technique based. 1020 CT slices from 108 patients with laboratory proven COVID-19 (the COVID-19 group) and 86 patients with other atypical and viral pneumonia diseases (the non-COVID-19 group) were included. Ten well-known convolutional neural networks were used to distinguish infection of COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 groups: AlexNet, VGG-16, VGG-19, SqueezeNet, GoogleNet, MobileNet-V2, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and Xception. Among all networks, the best performance was achieved by ResNet-101 and Xception. ResNet-101 could distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases with an AUC of 0.994 (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 99.02%; accuracy, 99.51%). Xception achieved an AUC of 0.994 (sensitivity, 98.04%; specificity, 100%; accuracy, 99.02%). However, the performance of the radiologist was moderate with an AUC of 0.873 (sensitivity, 89.21%; specificity, 83.33%; accuracy, 86.27%). ResNet-101 can be considered as a high sensitivity model to characterize and diagnose COVID-19 infections, and can be used as an adjuvant tool in radiology departments. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Computed tomography; Coronavirus infections; COVID-19; Deep learning; Lung diseases; Machine learning; Pneumonia","Computerized tomography; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Diagnosis; Disease control; Artificial intelligence techniques; Clinical practices; Diagnostic methods; Diagnostic tools; High sensitivity; Laboratory test; Learning techniques; Radiology departments; Deep learning; adult; alexnet; area under the curve; Article; artificial intelligence; clinical practice; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; female; googlenet; human; major clinical study; male; mobilenet v2; priority journal; radiologist; resnet 101; resnet 18; resnet 50; sensitivity and specificity; squeezenet; vgg 16; vgg 19; virus pneumonia; xception",,,,,,,"Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., Li, X., Yang, B., Song, J., Zhao, X., Tan, W., A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019 (2020) N.

Beside clinical procedures and treatments, since Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises a new paradigm for healthcare, several different AI tools that are built upon Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed for analyzing data and decision-making processes. This means that AI-driven tools help identify COVID-19 outbreaks as well as forecast their nature of spread across the globe. However, unlike other healthcare issues, for COVID-19, to detect COVID-19, AI-driven tools are expected to have active learning-based cross-population train/test models that employs multitudinal and multimodal data, which is the primary purpose of the paper. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Active learning; Artificial intelligence; COVID-19; Cross-population train/test models; Machine learning; Multitudinal and multimodal data","active learning; Article; artificial intelligence; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; cross population train; data analysis; epidemic; human; machine learning; medical informatics; nonhuman; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus detection; virus diagnosis; virus pneumonia; algorithm; Coronavirus infection; decision making; epidemic; forecasting; health care delivery; virus pneumonia; COVID-19; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Coronavirus Infections; Decision Making; Delivery of Health Care; Disease Outbreaks; Forecasting; Humans; Machine Learning; Pneumonia, Viral",,"COVID-19",,,,,"Wu, F., Zhao, S., Yu, B., Chen, Y.M., Wang, W., Song, Z.G., Hu, Y., Zhang, Y.Z., A new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in china (2020) Nature, 44 (59), pp. 265-269; (2020) Public Health Response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak – United States, , February 24; Chen, N., Zhou, M., Dong, X., Qu, J., Gong, F., Han, Y., Qiu, Y., Zhang, L., Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in wuhan, china: A descriptive study (2020) The Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 507-513. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/; (2020) Report, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation Report – 49, , https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200229-sitrep-40-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=849d0665_2, accessed March 09, 2020; Wu, Z., McGoogan, J.M., Characteristics of and important lessons from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: Summary of a report of 72,314 cases from the Chinese center for disease control and prevention (2020) JAMA; (2020) The WHO Declares Public Health Emergency for Novel Coronavirus, , https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/924596, January 30; Long, J.B., Ehrenfeld, J.M., The role of augmented intelligence (ai) in detecting and preventing the spread of novel coronavirus (2020) Journal of Medical Systems, 44; Paules, C.I., Marston, H.D., Fauci, A.S., Coronavirus infections – more than just the common cold (2020) JAMA, 323 (8), pp. 707-708; Drosten, C., Gunther, S., Identification of a novel corona virus in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003) N Engl J Med, 348, pp. 1967-1976; Peiris, J., Lai, S., Poon, L., Guan, Y., Yam, L., Lim, W., Nicholls, J., Yuen, K., Coronavirus as a possible cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003) The Lancet, 361 (9366); Song, Z., Xu, Y., Bao, L., Zhang, L., Yu, P., Qu, Y., Zhu, H., Qin, C., From sars to mers, thrusting coronaviruses into the spotlight (2019) Viruses, 11 (1). , https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/11/1/59; de Wit, E., van Doremalen, N., Falzarano, D., Munster, V.J., Sarsandmers: Recentinsights into emerging coronaviruses (2016) Nature Reviews Microbiology, 14 (8), pp. 523-534; Sammut, C., Webb, G.I., (2017) Encyclopedia of Machine Learning and Data Mining, , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4899-7687-1, Springer; Chen, J., Wu, L., Zhang, J., Zhang, L., Gong, D., Zhao, Y., Hu, S., Yu, H., (2020) Deep Learning-Based Model for Detecting 2019 Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia on High-Resolution Computed Tomography: A Prospective Study.

Design Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal. Data sources PubMed and Embase through Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv up to 24 March 2020. Study selection Studies that developed or validated a multivariable covid-19 related prediction model. Data extraction At least two authors independently extracted data using the CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist; risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool). Results 2696 titles were screened, and 27 studies describing 31 prediction models were included. Three models were identified for predicting hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as proxy outcomes for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; 18 diagnostic models for detecting covid-19 infection (13 were machine learning based on computed tomography scans); and 10 prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to severe disease, or length of hospital stay. Only one study used patient data from outside of China. The most reported predictors of presence of covid-19 in patients with suspected disease included age, body temperature, and signs and symptoms. The most reported predictors of severe prognosis in patients with covid-19 included age, sex, features derived from computed tomography scans, C reactive protein, lactic dehydrogenase, and lymphocyte count. C index estimates ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in prediction models for the general population (reported for all three models), from 0.81 to more than 0.99 in diagnostic models (reported for 13 of the 18 models), and from 0.85 to 0.98 in prognostic models (reported for six of the 10 models). All studies were rated at high risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, and high risk of model overfitting. Reporting quality varied substantially between studies. Most reports did not include a description of the study population or intended use of the models, and calibration of predictions was rarely assessed. Conclusion Prediction models for covid-19 are quickly entering the academic literature to support medical decision making at a time when they are urgently needed. This review indicates that proposed models are poorly reported, at high risk of bias, and their reported performance is probably optimistic. Immediate sharing of well documented individual participant data from covid-19 studies is needed for collaborative efforts to develop more rigorous prediction models and validate existing ones. The predictors identified in included studies could be considered as candidate predictors for new models. Methodological guidance should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions. Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline.

Such major viral outbreaks demand early elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 virus genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 virus genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing (MLDSP) for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp, including the 29 COVID-19 virus sequences available on January 27, 2020. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify the COVID-19 virus as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves 100% accurate classification of the COVID-19 virus sequences, and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations. This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification. © 2020 Randhawa et al.

SARS-CoV-2 with potential origin of bat is still circulating in China. In this study, a prediction model is proposed to evaluate the infection risk of non-human-origin coronavirus for early warning. Methods: The spike protein sequences of 2666 coronaviruses were collected from 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR) Database of China National Genomics Data Center on Jan 29, 2020. A total of 507 human-origin viruses were regarded as positive samples, whereas 2159 non-human-origin viruses were regarded as negative. To capture the key information of the spike protein, three feature encoding algorithms (amino acid composition, AAC; parallel correlation-based pseudo-amino-acid composition, PC-PseAAC and G-gap dipeptide composition, GGAP) were used to train 41 random forest models. The optimal feature with the best performance was identified by the multidimensional scaling method, which was used to explore the pattern of human coronavirus. Results: The 10-fold cross-validation results showed that well performance was achieved with the use of the GGAP (g = 3) feature. The predictive model achieved the maximum ACC of 98.18% coupled with the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.9638. Seven clusters for human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) were found. The cluster for SARS-CoV-2 was very close to that for SARS-CoV, which suggests that both of viruses have the same human receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme II). The big gap in the distance curve suggests that the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is not clear and further surveillance in the field should be made continuously. The smooth distance curve for SARS-CoV suggests that its close relatives still exist in nature and public health is challenged as usual. Conclusions: The optimal feature (GGAP, g = 3) performed well in terms of predicting infection risk and could be used to explore the evolutionary dynamic in a simple, fast and large-scale manner. The study may be beneficial for the surveillance of the genome mutation of coronavirus in the field. © 2020 The Author(s).","Coronavirus; Cross-species infection; Machine learning; Spike protein","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; virus spike protein; amino acid; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin-producing serum enzyme II; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; proteinase; virus receptor; amino acid composition; amino acid sequence; Article; correlation coefficient; evolution; false positive result; feature selection algorithm; infection risk; machine learning; mathematical model; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; multidimensional scaling; prediction; priority journal; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; SARS coronavirus; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus transmission; algorithm; animal; Betacoronavirus; China; Chlorocebus aethiops; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; disease carrier; genetics; genome; human; immunology; isolation and purification; metabolism; pandemic; phylogeny; risk assessment; virology; virus genome; virus pneumonia; Algorithms; Amino Acids; Animals; Betacoronavirus; China; Chlorocebus aethiops; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Reservoirs; Endopeptidases; Genome; Genome, Viral; Humans; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Phylogeny; Pneumonia, Viral; Receptors, Virus; Risk Assessment; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus",,"amino acid, 65072-01-7; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, 9015-82-1; proteinase, 9001-92-7; Amino Acids; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin-producing serum enzyme II; Endopeptidases; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Receptors, Virus; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus",,,"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province: 2018A030313380

The aim of this study is to explore the impacts of COVID-19 on people’s mental health, to assist policy makers to develop actionable policies, and help clinical practitioners (e.g., social workers, psychiatrists, and psychologists) provide timely services to affected populations. We sample and analyze the Weibo posts from 17,865 active Weibo users using the approach of Online Ecological Recognition (OER) based on several machine-learning predictive models. We calculated word frequency, scores of emotional indicators (e.g., anxiety, depression, indignation, and Oxford happiness) and cognitive indicators (e.g., social risk judgment and life satisfaction) from the collected data. The sentiment analysis and the paired sample t-test were performed to examine the differences in the same group before and after the declaration of COVID-19 on 20 January, 2020. The results showed that negative emotions (e.g., anxiety, depression and indignation) and sensitivity to social risks increased, while the scores of positive emotions (e.g., Oxford happiness) and life satisfaction decreased. People were concerned more about their health and family, while less about leisure and friends. The results contribute to the knowledge gaps of short-term individual changes in psychological conditions after the outbreak. It may provide references for policy makers to plan and fight against COVID-19 effectively by improving stability of popular feelings and urgently prepare clinical practitioners to deliver corresponding therapy foundations for the risk groups and affected people. © 2020 by the authors.

To contain its spread, China adopted unprecedented nationwide interventions on January 23 2020. These policies included large-scale quarantine, strict controls on travel and extensive monitoring of suspected cases. However, it is unknown whether these policies have had an impact on the epidemic. We sought to show how these control measures impacted the containment of the epidemic. Methods: We integrated population migration data before and after January 23 and most updated COVID-19 epidemiological data into the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model to derive the epidemic curve. We also used an artificial intelligence (AI) approach, trained on the 2003 SARS data, to predict the epidemic. Results: We found that the epidemic of China should peak by late February, showing gradual decline by end of April. A five-day delay in implementation would have increased epidemic size in mainland China three-fold. Lifting the Hubei quarantine would lead to a second epidemic peak in Hubei province in mid-March and extend the epidemic to late April, a result corroborated by the machine learning prediction. Conclusions: Our dynamic SEIR model was effective in predicting the COVID-19 epidemic peaks and sizes. The implementation of control measures on January 23 2020 was indispensable in reducing the eventual COVID-19 epidemic size. © Journal of Thoracic Disease.

At the time of writing this article (April 2020), the world is drastically influenced by the COVID-19. Recently, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) was published. For researchers on ID such as ourselves, it is of key interest to learn whether this open research dataset may be used to investigate the virus and its consequences for people with an ID. Methods: From CORD-19, we identified full-text articles containing terms related to the ID care and applied a text mining technique, specifically the term frequency–inverse document frequency analysis in combination with K-means clustering. Results: Two hundred fifty-nine articles contained one or more of our specified terms related to ID. We were able to cluster these articles related to ID into five clusters on different topics, namely: mental health, viral diseases, diagnoses and treatments, maternal care and paediatrics, and genetics. Conclusion: The CORD-19 open research dataset consists of valuable information about not only COVID-19 disease but also ID and the relationship between them.

The model is built to predict the number of confirmed cases, recovered cases, and death cases based on the data available between 22nd Jan 2020 to 3rd Apr 2020. The time series forecasting method is used for prediction models.Result:The COVID-19 effects are predicted to be at peak between the third and fourth weeks of Apr 2020 in India. This outbreak is predicted to be controlled around the end of May 2020. The total number of predicted confirmed cases of COVID-19 might reach around 68978, and the numbers of deaths due to COVID-19 are predicted to be 1557 around 25th Apr 2020 in India. If this outbreak is not controlled by the end of May 2020, then India will face a severe shortage of hospitals, and it will make this outbreak even worse. © 2020 Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health, Inc.","COVID-19 Epidemic trend; COVID-19 Outbreak in India; Machine Learning; Predictive Model",,,,,,,,"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reportsEstimatetheincubationperiodofcoronavirus2019(COVID-19)), WHO Situation Report-1; https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/countries-where-coronavirus-has-spread/; https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reportsEstimatetheincubationperiodofcoronavirus2019(COVID-19)), WHO Situation Report-69; Junxiong, P., Wang Min, X., Ang Ian, Y.H., Tan Sharon, H.X., Lewis Ruth, F., Chen Jacinta.-, P., Gutierrez Ramona, A., Hsu Li, Y., Potential Rapid Diagnostics, Vaccine and Therapeutics for 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV): A Systematic Review (2020) J.

Compared with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest computed tomography (CT) imaging may be a significantly more trustworthy, useful, and rapid technique to classify and evaluate COVID-19, specifically in the epidemic region. Almost all hospitals have CT imaging machines; therefore, the chest CT images can be utilized for early classification of COVID-19 patients. However, the chest CT-based COVID-19 classification involves a radiology expert and considerable time, which is valuable when COVID-19 infection is growing at rapid rate. Therefore, an automated analysis of chest CT images is desirable to save the medical professionals’ precious time. In this paper, a convolutional neural networks (CNN) is used to classify the COVID-19-infected patients as infected (+ve) or not (−ve). Additionally, the initial parameters of CNN are tuned using multi-objective differential evolution (MODE). Extensive experiments are performed by considering the proposed and the competitive machine learning techniques on the chest CT images. Extensive analysis shows that the proposed model can classify the chest CT images at a good accuracy rate. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Chest CT; Convolutional neural networks;

The high mortality rate associated with this disease has been a major cause of concern. This paper aims at identifying the major factors influencing MERS recovery in KSA. Methods: The data used for analysis was collected from the Ministry of Health website, KSA. The important factors impelling the recovery are found using machine learning. Machine learning models such as support vector machine, conditional inference tree, naïve Bayes and J48 are modelled to identify the important factors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis is also carried out to identify the significant factors statistically. Result: The main factors influencing MERS recovery rate are identified as age, pre-existing diseases, severity of disease and whether the patient is a healthcare worker or not. In spite of MERS being a zoonotic disease, contact with camels is not a major factor influencing recovery. Conclusion: The methods used were able to determine the prime factors influencing MERS recovery. It can be comprehended that awareness about symptoms and seeking medical intervention at the onset of development of symptoms will make a long way in reducing the mortality rate. © 2019","Infectious disease; Machine learning; MERS; Saudi Arabia; Survival rate","adolescent; adult; aged; Article; Bayesian learning; camel; child; comorbidity; conditional inference tree; convalescence; decision tree; disease severity; female; groups by age; health care personnel; human; machine learning; major clinical study; male; Middle East respiratory syndrome; mortality rate; priority journal; risk factor; Saudi Arabia; support vector machine; survival rate; Bayes theorem; Coronavirus infection; infant; middle aged; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; mortality; multivariate analysis; preschool child; regression analysis; severity of illness index; survival; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Bayes Theorem; Child; Child, Preschool; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Infant; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Multivariate Analysis; Regression Analysis; Saudi Arabia; Severity of Illness Index; Support Vector Machine; Survival; Young Adult",,,,,,,"Morens, D.M., Folkers, G.K., Fauci, A.S., The challenge of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (2004) Nature, 430, pp. 242-249; Zaki, A.M., Van Boheemen, S., Bestebroer, T.M., Osterhaus, A.D.M.E., Fouchier, R.A.M., Isolation of a novel coronavirus from a man with pneumonia in Saudi Arabia (2012) N Engl J Med, 367, pp. 1814-1820; Arabi, Y.M., Bouchama, A., Luke, T., Baillie, J.K., Al Omari, A., Hajeer, A.H., Middle East respiratory syndrome (2017) N Engl J Med, 376, pp. 586-594; Cotten, M., Watson, S.J., Kellam, P., Transmission and evolution of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in Saudi Arabia: a descriptive genomic study (2013) Lancet, 382, pp. 1993-2002; Gossner, C., Danielson, N., Gervelmeyer, A., Berthe, F., Faye, B., Kaasik Aaslav, K., Human dromedary camel interactions and the risk of acquiring zoonotic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection (2016) Zoonoses Public Health, 63, pp. 1-9; Azhar, E.I., El-Kafrawy, S.A., Farraj, S.A., Hassan, A.M., Al-Saeed, M.S., Hashem, A.M., Evidence for camel-to-human transmission of MERS coronavirus (2014) N Engl J Med, 370, pp. 2499-2505; Kasem, S., Qasim, I., Al-Hufofi, A., Hashim, O., Alkarar, A., Abu-Obeida, A., Cross-sectional study of MERS-CoV-specific RNA and antibodies in animals that have had contact with MERS patients in Saudi Arabia (2018) J Infect Public Health, 11, pp. 331-338; Assiri, A., McGeer, A., Perl, T.M., Price, C.S., Al Rabeeah, A.A., Cummings, D.A.T., Hospital outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (2013) N Engl J Med, 369, pp. 407-416; Memish, Z.A., Zumla, A.I., Al-Hakeem, R.F., Al-Rabeeah, A.A., Stephens, G.M., Family cluster of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections (2013) N Engl J Med, 368, pp. 2487-2494; Omrani, A.S., Matin, M.A., Haddad, Q., Al-Nakhli, D., Memish, Z.A., Albarrak, A.M., A family cluster of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections related to a likely unrecognized asymptomatic or mild case (2013) Int J Infect Dis, 17, pp. 668-672; Memish, Z.A., Cotten, M., Watson, S.J., Kellam, P., Zumla, A., Alhakeem, R.F., Community case clusters of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in Hafr Al-Batin, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: a descriptive genomic study (2014) Int J Infect Dis, 23, pp. 63-68; Hui, D.S., Azhar, E.I., Kim, Y.-J., Memish, Z.A., Oh, M., Zumla, A., Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus: risk factors and determinants of primary, household, and nosocomial transmission (2018) Lancet Infect Dis, 3099, pp. 1-11; Breban, R., Riou, J., Fontanet, A., Interhuman transmissibility of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: estimation of pandemic risk (2013) Lancet, 382, pp. 694-699; Al-Mohrej, O.A., Al-Shirian, S.D., Al-Otaibi, S.K., Tamim, H.M., Masuadi, E.M., Fakhoury, H.M., Is the Saudi Public aware of Middle East respiratory syndrome?

The first case of PEDV in Canada was identified on an Ontario farm in January 2014. Surveillance was instrumental in identifying the initial case and in minimizing the spread of the virus to other farms. With recent advances in predictive analytics showing promise for health and disease forecasting, the primary objective of this study was to apply machine learning predictive methods (random forest, artificial neural networks, and classification and regression trees) to provincial PEDV incidence data, and in so doing determine their accuracy for predicting future PEDV trends. Trend was defined as the cumulative number of new cases over a four-week interval, and consisted of four levels (zero, low, medium and high). Provincial PEDV incidence and prevalence estimates from an industry database, as well as temperature, humidity, and precipitation data, were combined to create the forecast dataset. With 10-fold cross validation performed on the entire dataset, the overall accuracy was 0.68 (95% CI: 0.60 – 0.75), 0.57 (95% CI: 0.49 – 0.64), and 0.55 (0.47 – 0.63) for the random forest, artificial neural network, and classification and regression tree models, respectively. Based on the cross-validation approach to evaluating predictive accuracy, the random forest model provided the best prediction. © 2019","Artificial neural networks; Classification and regression trees; Disease forecasting; Disease surveillance; Porcine epidemic diarrhea; Random forest","Article; forecasting; herd; humidity; incidence; machine learning; nonhuman; Ontario; porcine epidemic diarrhea; prevalence; priority journal; random forest; temperature; animal; Coronavirus infection; pig; Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; swine disease; veterinary medicine; virology; Animals; Coronavirus Infections; Ontario; Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; Swine; Swine Diseases",,,,,,"The authors are thankful to Ontario Swine Health Advisory Board for sharing the data and to producers who contributed to the surveillance system.

This not only aids to understand the disease mechanism, but also helps to identify unexpected therapeutic activity or adverse side effects of drugs. Hence, drug-target interaction prediction becomes an essential tool in the field of drug repurposing. The availability of heterogeneous biological data on known drug-target interactions enabled many researchers to develop various computational methods to decipher unknown drug-target interactions. This review provides an overview on these computational methods for predicting drug-target interactions along with available webservers and databases for drug-target interactions. Further, the applicability of drug-target interactions in various diseases for identifying lead compounds has been outlined. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.","Drug design; Drug repurposing; Drug-target interaction; Feature based method; Machine learning; Polypharmacology; Semi-supervised method; Similarity based method; Supervised method","3 oxoacyl acyl carrier protein reductase; acetylcholinesterase; aldehyde reductase; alpha glucosidase; amyloid beta protein; B Raf kinase; DNA topoisomerase; ephrin receptor B4; glucokinase; Human immunodeficiency virus proteinase; integrase; phospholipase A2; prostaglandin synthase; protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B; proteinase; RNA directed RNA polymerase; secretase; sortase; urease; protein binding; amino acid sequence; computer prediction; correspondence analysis; drug design; drug repositioning; drug structure; drug targeting; gene expression; isothermal titration calorimetry; kernel method; machine learning; mathematical computing; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; protein interaction; protein protein interaction; Review; SARS coronavirus; spectrofluorometry; structure activity relation; X ray crystallography; algorithm; biology; chemical database; chemical structure; computer simulation; drug development; human; procedures; protein database; Algorithms; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Databases, Chemical; Databases, Protein; Drug Discovery; Humans; Molecular Structure; Protein Binding; Structure-Activity Relationship",,"3 oxoacyl acyl carrier protein reductase, 37250-34-3; acetylcholinesterase, 9000-81-1; aldehyde reductase, 58591-34-7, 9023-11-4, 9028-31-3; alpha glucosidase, 9001-42-7; amyloid beta protein, 109770-29-8; DNA topoisomerase, 80449-01-0; glucokinase, 37237-53-9, 9001-36-9; Human immunodeficiency virus proteinase, 144114-21-6; phospholipase A2, 9001-84-7; prostaglandin synthase, 39391-18-9, 59763-19-8, 9055-65-6; proteinase, 9001-92-7; RNA directed RNA polymerase, 9026-28-2; urease, 9002-13-5",,,"Department of Science and Technology, Government of Kerala: SR/WOS/LS62/2013","SA thanks Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India, New Delhi, for the research grant (Grant No: SR/WOS/LS62/2013) under Women Scientist Scheme-A.

MERS is caused by MERS-CoV, an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae. Despite expert opinions that the danger of MERS might be exaggerated, there was an overreaction by the public according to the Korean mass media, which led to a noticeable reduction in social and economic activities during the outbreak. To explain this phenomenon, we presumed that machine learning-based analysis of media outlets would be helpful and collected a number of Korean mass media articles and short-text comments produced during the 10-week outbreak. To process and analyze the collected data (over 86 million words in total) effectively, we created a methodology composed of machine-learning and information-theoretic approaches. Our proposal included techniques for extracting emotions from emoticons and Internet slang, which allowed us to significantly (approximately 73%) increase the number of emotion-bearing texts needed for robust sentiment analysis of social media. As a result, we discovered a plausible explanation for the public overreaction to MERS in terms of the interplay between the disease, mass media, and public emotions. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Machine learning; Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); Natural language processing; Sentiment analysis","Article; controlled study; data analysis; data processing; economic aspect; emotion; epidemic; Internet; language processing; machine learning; mass medium; Middle East respiratory syndrome; priority journal; public opinion; social behavior; social media; South Korea; text messaging; Coronavirus infection; human; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; pathogenicity; virology; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Machine Learning; Mass Media; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Republic of Korea",,,,,"Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy

Accumulation of such data (e.g., genomics, proteomics, metabolomics etc.) is fast becoming more common and thus requires the development and implementation of effective data mining strategies designed for biological and clinical applications. Multiplex microbead immunoassay (MMIA), on xMAP or MagPix platform (Luminex), which is amenable to automation, offers a major advantage over conventional methods such as Western blot or ELISA, for increasing the efficiencies in serodiagnosis of infectious diseases. MMIA allows detection of antibodies and/or antigens efficiently for a wide range of infectious agents simultaneously in host blood samples, in one reaction vessel. In the process, MMIA generates large volumes of data. In this report we demonstrate the application of data mining tools on how the inherent large volume data can improve the assay tolerance (measured in terms of sensitivity and specificity) by analysis of experimental data accumulated over a span of two years. The combination of prior knowledge with machine learning tools provides an efficient approach to improve the diagnostic power of the assay in a continuous basis. Furthermore, this study provides an in-depth knowledge base to study pathological trends of infectious agents in mouse colonies on a multivariate scale. Data mining techniques using serodetection of infections in mice, developed in this study, can be used as a general model for more complex applications in epidemiology and clinical translational research. © 2015 Mani et al.",,"animal cell;

Despite immense potential, a viral siRNA efficacy prediction algorithm is still not available. Moreover, performances of the existing general mammalian siRNA efficacy predictors are not satisfactory for viral siRNAs. Therefore, we have developed "" VIRsiRNApred"" a support vector machine (SVM) based method for predicting the efficacy of viral siRNA. Methods: In the present study, we have employed a new dataset of 1725 viral siRNAs with experimentally verified quantitative efficacies tested under heterogeneous experimental conditions and targeting as many as 37 important human viruses including HIV, Influenza, HCV, HBV, SARS etc. These siRNAs were divided into training (T1380) and validation (V345) datasets. Important siRNA sequence features including mono to penta nucleotide frequencies, binary pattern, thermodynamic properties and secondary structure were employed for model development. Results: During 10-fold cross validation on T1380 using hybrid approach, we achieved a maximum Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.55 between predicted and actual efficacy of viral siRNAs. On V345 independent dataset, our best model achieved a maximum correlation of 0.50 while existing general siRNA prediction methods showed PCC from 0.05 to 0.18. However, using leave one out cross validation PCC was improved to 0.58 and 0.55 on training and validation datasets respectively. SVM performed better than other machine learning techniques used like ANN, KNN and REP Tree. Conclusion: VIRsiRNApred is the first algorithm for predicting inhibition efficacy of viral siRNAs which is developed using experimentally verified viral siRNAs. We hope this algorithm would be useful in predicting highly potent viral siRNA to aid siRNA based antiviral therapeutics development.

The various prediction algorithms are being used to capture the MHC peptide binding preference, allowing the rapid scan of entire pathogen proteomes for peptide likely to bind MHC, saving the cost, effort, and time. However, the number of known binders/non-binders (BNB) to a specific MHC molecule is limited in many cases, which still poses a computational challenge for prediction. The training data should be adequate to predict BNB using any machine learning approach. In this study, variable learning rate has been demonstrated for training artificial neural network and predicting BNB for small datasets. The approach can be used for large datasets as well. The dataset for different MHC class I alleles for SARS Corona virus (Tor2 Replicase polyprotein 1ab) has been used for training and prediction of BNB. A total of 90 datasets (nine different MHC class I alleles with tenfold cross validation) have been retrieved from IEDB database for BNB. For fixed learning rate approach, the best value of AROC is 0.65, and in most of the cases it is 0.5, which shows the poor predictions. In case of variable learning rate, of the 90 datasets the value of AROC for 76 datasets is between 0.806 and 1.0 and for 7 datasets the value is between 0.7 and 0.8 and for rest of 7 datasets it is between 0.5 and 0.7, which indicates very good performance in most of the cases. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Artificial neural network; Epitope prediction; MHC class I binder/non-binder; SARS Corona virus; T-cell immune response; Vaccine designing; Variable learning rate","major histocompatibility antigen class 1; peptide; HLA antigen class 1; allele; artificial neural network; case study; conference paper; controlled study; data base; information retrieval; learning algorithm; nonhuman; prediction; priority journal; SARS coronavirus; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; binding site; biology; evaluation; gene; genetic database; genetics; human; immunology; metabolism; protein binding; proteomics; statistics; validation study; Algorithms; Alleles; Artificial Intelligence; Binding Sites; Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Genes, MHC Class I; Histocompatibility Antigens Class I; Humans; Neural Networks (Computer); Protein Binding; Proteomics; SARS Virus",,"Histocompatibility Antigens Class I",,,,,"Robinson, H.L., Amara, R.R., T cell vaccines for microbial infections (2005) Nature Medicine, 11 (4 SUPPL.), pp. S25-S32. , DOI 10/nm1212; De Groot, A.S., Rappuoli, R., Genome-derived vaccines (2004) Expert Review of Vaccines, 3 (1), pp. 59-76. , DOI 10.1586/14760584.3.1.59; De Groot, A.S., Sbai, H., Aubin, C.S., McMurry, J., Martin, W., Immuno-informatics: Mining genomes for vaccine components (2002) Immunology and Cell Biology, 80 (3), pp. 255-269. , DOI 10.1046/j.1440-1711.2002.01092.x; Rappuoli, R., Reverse vaccinology, a genome-based approach to vaccine development (2001) Vaccine, 19 (17-19), pp. 2688-2691. , DOI 10.1016/S0264-410X(00)00554-5, PII S0264410X00005545; Tamas, G.S., Critical role of glycosylation in determining the length and structure of T-cell epitopes-As suggested by a combined in silico systems biology approach (2009) Immunome Research, 5, p. 4; Holmes, K.V., SARS coronavirus: A new challenge for prevention and therapy (2003) Journal of Clinical Investigation, 111 (11), pp. 1605-1609; Tong, J.C., Methods and protocols for prediction of immuno-genic epitopes (2006) Briefings in Bioinformatics, 8 (2), pp. 96-108; Zhao, B., MHC-binding peptide prediction for epitope based vaccine design (2007) International Journal of Integrative Biology, 1 (2), pp. 127-140; Armano, G., A hybrid genetic-neural system for predicting protein secondary structure (2005) BMC Bioinformatics, 6 (4), pp. S3; Yeon-Jin, C., Prediction rule generation of MHC class i binding peptides using ANN and GA, LICNC 2005 (2005) LNCS, 3610, pp. 1009-1016; Brusic, V., Rudy, G., Honeyman, M., Hammer, J., Harrison, L., Prediction of MHC class II-binding peptides using an evolutionary algorithm and artificial neural network (1998) Bioinformatics, 14 (2), pp. 121-130; Riedesel, H., Peptide binding at class i major histo-compatibility complex scored with linear functions and support vector machines (2004) Genome Informatics, 15 (1), pp. 198-212; Bhasin, M., Raghava, G.P.S., A hybrid approach for predicting promiscuous MHC class I restricted T cell epitopes (2007) Journal of Biosciences, 32 (1), pp. 31-42. , http://www.ias.ac.in/jbiosci/jan2007/31-42.pdf, DOI 10.1007/s12038-007-0004-5; Soam, S.S., Prediction of MHC class i binding peptides using probability distribution functions (2009) Bioinformation, 3 (9), pp. 403-408; Singh, S.P., Evaluation of threading based method for prediction of peptides binding to MHC class i alleles (2008) International Journal of Integrative Biology, 4 (1), pp. 16-20; Singh, S.P., Prediction ofMHC binding peptides using Gibbs motif sampler, weight matrix and artificial neural network (2008) Bioinformation, 3 (4), pp. 150-155; Tollenaere, T., SuperSAB: Fast adaptive back-propagation with good scaling properties (1990) Neural Networks, 3 (5), pp. 561-573; Castillo, E., Guijarro-Berdinas, B., Fontenla-Romero, O., Alonso-Betanzos, A., A very fast learning method for neural networks based on sensitivity analysis (2006) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 7, pp. 1159-1182. , http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume7/castillo06a/castillo06a.pdf","Mishra, B.N.; Department of Biotechnology, Institute of Engineering and Technology, UP Technical University, Lucknow, India; email: profbnmishra@gmail.com","Arabnia H.R.Tran Q.N.",,,,,,,00652598,9781441970459,AEMBA,"21431562","English","Adv.

The challenges and the quickly rising public interest when a virus is becoming a threat has significantly influenced computational drug discovery. The most obvious example is anti-AIDS research, where HIV protease and reverse transcriptase have triggered enormous efforts in developing and improving computational methods. Methods applied to anti-viral research include (i) ligandbased approaches that rely on known active compounds to extrapolate biological activity, such as machine learning techniques or classical QSAR, (ii) structure-based methods that rely on an experimentally determined 3D structure of the targets, such as molecular docking or molecular dynamics, and (iii) universal approaches that can be applied in a structureor ligand-based way, such as 3D QSAR or 3D pharmacophore elucidation. In this review we summarize these molecular modeling approaches as they were applied to fight anti-viral diseases and highlight their importance for anti-viral research. We discuss the role of computational chemistry in the development of small molecules as agents against HIV integrase, HIV-1 protease, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, the influenza virus M2 channel protein, influenza virus neuraminidase, the SARS coronavirus main proteinase and spike protein, thymidine kinases of herpes viruses, hepatitis C virus proteins and other flaviviruses as well as human rhinovirus coat protein and proteases, and other picornaviridae. We highlight how computational approaches have helped in discovering anti-viral activities of natural products and give an overview on polypharmacology approaches that help to optimize drugs against several viruses or help to optimize the metabolic profile of and anti-viral drug. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","Activity profiling; Computational chemistry; Docking; Drugs from natural sources; Fingerprints; HCV NS3/4A serine protease; HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase; Hepatitis C virus; Herpes; HIV; HIV integrase; HIV-1 protease; HIV-1 reverse transcriptase; Homology modeling; HRV capsid protein; HRV protease 2A; HRV protease 3C; HSV; Human a- glucosidase; Influenza virus; Inverse screening; Lead structure development; M2 channel protein; Molecular dynamics simulation; Molecular interaction fields; Molecular modeling; Natural compounds; Neuraminidase; Parallel screening; Pharmacophore modeling; QSAR; SARS-CoV; Similarity-based screening; Thymidine kinase; Viral disease; Virtual screening; Virus","alpha glucosidase; antivirus agent; capsid protein; ciluprevir; coat protein; delavirdine; efavirenz; etravirine; herpes c virus protein; Human immunodeficiency virus proteinase; influenza virus neuraminidase; ligand; nevirapine; nonstructural protein 3; nonstructural protein 4A; nonstructural protein 5B; protein M2; raltegravir; rhinovirus coat protein; RNA directed DNA polymerase; SARS coronavirus main proteinase; telaprevir; thymidine kinase; unclassified drug; virus protein; virus sialidase; virus spike protein; antiviral activity; article; artificial neural network; binding affinity; drug binding; drug research; drug screening; drug structure; Flavivirus; Herpes virus; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; hydrophobicity; Influenza virus; medical research; metabolic capacity; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; molecular interaction; molecular model; nonhuman; Picornavirus; SARS coronavirus; virus infection",,"alpha glucosidase, 9001-42-7; ciluprevir, 300832-84-2; delavirdine, 136817-59-9; efavirenz, 154598-52-4; etravirine, 269055-15-4; Human immunodeficiency virus proteinase, 144114-21-6; nevirapine, 129618-40-2; raltegravir, 518048-05-0, 871038-72-1, 889131-29-7; RNA directed DNA polymerase, 37213-50-6, 9068-38-6; telaprevir, 402957-28-2; thymidine kinase, 9002-06-6, 9086-73-1","biln 2061; vx 950","Boehringer Ingelheim; Bristol Myers Squibb; Merck; Pfizer; Tibotec",,,"Patterson, K.B., Runge, T., Smallpox and the Native American (2002) Am.

The need for high containment to work with live agents limits the amount and types of research that can be done using complete pathogens, and small markets reduce potential returns for industry. However, a number of tools, from comparative pathogenesis of viral strains at the molecular level to novel computational approaches, are being used to understand the basis of viral attenuation and characterize protective immune responses. As the amount of basic molecular knowledge grows, we will be able to take advantage of these tools not only to rationally attenuate virus strains for candidate vaccines, but also to assess immunogenicity and safety in silico. This review discusses how a basic understanding of pathogenesis, allied with systems biology and machine learning methods, can impact biodefense vaccinology. Copyright © 2010 G. C. Bowick and A. D.

However, a substantial percentage of these ORFs have no significant sequence similarity to those of known proteins, which complicates the task for probing their function. Computational methods complement or in combination with sequence alignment and clustering methods are being explored. In this work, we represent a learning algorithm-based method for functional classification of ORFs in complete genomes of 4 different viruses HIV-1, hepatitis B, human adenovirus and SARS coronavirus. Of the 80 functionally-annotated ORFs in all these viral genomes, 85% have the predicted functional classes in various degrees consistent with the annotated functions, 12.5% are misclassified and 2.5% are unpredictable by class because the corresponding annotated classes are not covered by SVMProt. Our study suggests that our SVMProt may, to a certain extent, provide useful hint about the function of the ORFs in the viral genomes.","Function annotation; ORF; SVM; Viral genome","Classification (of information);

Identification of their function facilitates a mechanistic understanding of SARS infection and drug development for its treatment. The sequence of the majority of these putative proteins has no significant similarity to those of known proteins, which complicates the task of using sequence analysis tools to probe their function. Support vector machines (SVM), useful for predicting the functional class of distantly related proteins, is employed to ascribe a possible functional class to SARS-CoV proteins. Testing results indicate that SVM is able to predict the functional class of 73% of the known SARS-CoV proteins with available sequences and 67% of 18 other novel viral proteins. A combination of the sequence comparison method BLAST and SVMProt can further improve the prediction accuracy of SMVProt such that the functional class of two additional SARS-CoV proteins is correctly predicted. Our study suggests that the SARS-CoV genome possibly contains a putative voltage-gated ion channel, structural proteins, a carbon-oxygen lyase, oxidoreductases acting on the CH-OH group of donors, and an ATP-binding cassette transporter.

Several sequences of the complete genome of SARS-CoV have been determined. The subcellular localization (SubLocation) of annotated open-reading frames of the SARS-CoV genome was predicted using a support vector machine. Several gene products were predicted to locate in the Golgi body and cell nucleus. The SubLocation information was combined with predicted transmembrane information to develop a model of the viral life cycle. The results show that this information can be used to predict the functions of genes and even the virus pathogenesis. In addition, the entire SARS viral genome sequences currently available in GenBank were compared to identify the sequence variations among different isolates. Some variations in the Hong Kong strains may be related to the special clinical manifestations and provide clues for understanding the relationship between gene functions and evolution. These variations reflect the evolution of the SARS virus in human populations and may help development of a vaccine.","Genomic polymorphism; Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); Subcellular localization; Viral life cycle","Forecasting; Genes; Learning systems; Life cycle; Proteins; Genome sequences; Genomic polymorphism; Severe acute respiratory syndrome; Special clinical manifestations; Subcellular localization; Viral life cycle; Viruses",,,,,,,"Peiris, J.S.M., Lai, S.T., Poon, L.L.M., Guan, Y., Yam, L.Y.C., Lim, W., Nicholls, J., Yuen, K.Y., Coronavirus as a possible cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003) Lancet, 361 (9366), pp. 1319-1325. , members of the SARS study group; Drosten, C., Gunther, S., Preiser, W., Werf, S., Brodt, H.R., Decker, S., Rabenau, H., Doerr, H.W., Identification of a novel coronavirus in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003) New Engl.
