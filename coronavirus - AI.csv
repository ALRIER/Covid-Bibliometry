We aim to review the role of AI as a decisive technology to analyze, prepare us for prevention and fight with COVID-19 (Coronavirus) and other pandemics. Methods: The rapid review of the literature is done on the database of Pubmed, Scopus and Google Scholar using the keyword of COVID-19 or Coronavirus and Artificial Intelligence or AI. Collected the latest information regarding AI for COVID-19, then analyzed the same to identify its possible application for this disease. Results: We have identified seven significant applications of AI for COVID-19 pandemic. This technology plays an important role to detect the cluster of cases and to predict where this virus will affect in future by collecting and analyzing all previous data. Conclusions: Healthcare organizations are in an urgent need for decision-making technologies to handle this virus and help them in getting proper suggestions in real-time to avoid its spread. AI works in a proficient way to mimic like human intelligence. It may also play a vital role in understanding and suggesting the development of a vaccine for COVID-19. This result-driven technology is used for proper screening, analyzing, prediction and tracking of current patients and likely future patients. The significant applications are applied to tracks data of confirmed, recovered and death cases. © 2020 Diabetes India","AI Applications; Artificial Intelligence (AI); Coronavirus; COVID-19; Pandemic","antivirus agent; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine; unclassified drug; virus vaccine; Article; artificial intelligence; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; data analysis; drug delivery system; early diagnosis; health care personnel; human; mortality; pandemic; priority journal; systematic review; workload",,,,,,,"Haleem, A., Javaid, M., Vaishya, Effects of COVID 19 pandemic in daily life (2020) Curr Med Res Pract; Bai, H.X., Hsieh, B., Xiong, Z., Halsey, K., Choi, J.W., Tran, T.M., Pan, I., Jiang, X.L., Performance of radiologists in differentiating COVID-19 from viral pneumonia on chest CT (2020) Radiology; Hu, Z., Ge, Q., Jin, L., Xiong, M., (2002), Artificial intelligence forecasting of COVID-19 in China. arXiv preprint arXiv07112. 2020 Feb 17; Ai, T., Yang, Z., Hou, H., Zhan, C., Chen, C., Lv, W., Tao, Q., Xia, L., Correlation of chest CT and RT-PCR testing in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China: a report of 1014 cases (2020) Radiology; Luo, H., Tang, Q.L., Shang, Y.X., Liang, S.B., Yang, M., Robinson, N., Liu, J.P., Can Chinese medicine be used for prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?

The crucial action to gain the force in the fight of COVID-19 is to have powerful monitoring of the site forming infected patients. Most of the initial tests rely on detecting the genetic material of the coronavirus, and they have a poor detection rate with the time-consuming operation. In the ongoing process, radiological imaging is also preferred where chest X-rays are highlighted in the diagnosis. Early studies express the patients with an abnormality in chest X-rays pointing to the presence of the COVID-19. On this motivation, there are several studies cover the deep learning-based solutions to detect the COVID-19 using chest X-rays. A part of the existing studies use non-public datasets, others perform on complicated Artificial Intelligent (AI) structures. In our study, we demonstrate an AI-based structure to outperform the existing studies. The SqueezeNet that comes forward with its light network design is tuned for the COVID-19 diagnosis with Bayesian optimization additive. Fine-tuned hyperparameters and augmented dataset make the proposed network perform much better than existing network designs and to obtain a higher COVID-19 diagnosis accuracy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bayesian Optimization; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Deep Learning; Rapid Diagnosis of COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2","Article; artificial intelligence; Bayesian learning; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; decision making; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; disease classification; human; image processing; intermethod comparison; pneumonia; process optimization; thorax radiography; X ray analysis",,,,,,,"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019, WHO - Coronavirus disease 2019 info web site n.d.

A model to classify and predict the levels of respective respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials of the various viruses was built before the outbreak of MERS-CoV using AI and empirically-based molecular tools to predict the disorder level of proteins. Using the percentages of intrinsic disorder (PID) of the nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins of CoV, the model easily clustered the viruses into three groups with the SARS-CoV (M PID = 8%, N PID = 50%) falling into Category B, in which viruses have intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials. Later, MERS-CoV (M PID = 9%, N PID = 44%) was found to be in Category C, which consists of viruses with lower respiratory transmission potential but with higher fecal-oral transmission capabilities. Based on the peculiarities of disorder distribution, the SARS-CoV-2 (M PID = 6%, N PID = 48%) has to be placed in Category B. Our data show however, that the SARS-CoV-2 is very strange with one of the hardest protective outer shell, (M PID = 6%) among coronaviruses. This means that it might be expected to be highly resilient in saliva or other body fluids and outside the body. An infected body is likelier to shed greater numbers of viral particles since the latter is more resistant to antimicrobial enzymes in body fluids. These particles are also likelier to remain active longer. These factors could account for the greater contagiousness of the SARS-CoV-2 and have implications for efforts to prevent its spread. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coronavirus; CoV; COVID; Intrinsically disordered protein; Membrane; MERS; Nucleocapsid; SARS; Spread","intrinsically disordered protein; membrane protein; nucleocapsid protein; Article; artificial intelligence; body fluid; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; human; lower respiratory tract; mathematical model; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; prediction; priority journal; saliva; SARS-related coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus particle; virus transmission",,,,,,,"WHO, Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019; Goh, G.K., Dunker, A.K., Foster, J.A., Uversky, V.N., Rigidity of outer shell predicted by protein disorder model sheds light on COVID-19(Wuhan-2019-nCoV) infectivity (2020) Biomolecules, 199, p. e221; Li, X., Zai, J., Zhao, Q., Nie, Q., Li, Y., Foley, B.T., Chaillon, A., Evolutionary history, potential intermediate animal host, and cross-species analyses of SARS-CoV-2 (2020) J.

It has caused a devastating effect on both daily lives, public health, and the global economy. It is critical to detect the positive cases as early as possible so as to prevent the further spread of this epidemic and to quickly treat affected patients. The need for auxiliary diagnostic tools has increased as there are no accurate automated toolkits available. Recent findings obtained using radiology imaging techniques suggest that such images contain salient information about the COVID-19 virus. Application of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques coupled with radiological imaging can be helpful for the accurate detection of this disease, and can also be assistive to overcome the problem of a lack of specialized physicians in remote villages. In this study, a new model for automatic COVID-19 detection using raw chest X-ray images is presented. The proposed model is developed to provide accurate diagnostics for binary classification (COVID vs. No-Findings) and multi-class classification (COVID vs. No-Findings vs. Pneumonia). Our model produced a classification accuracy of 98.08% for binary classes and 87.02% for multi-class cases. The DarkNet model was used in our study as a classifier for the you only look once (YOLO) real time object detection system. We implemented 17 convolutional layers and introduced different filtering on each layer. Our model (available at (https://github.com/muhammedtalo/COVID-19)) can be employed to assist radiologists in validating their initial screening, and can also be employed via cloud to immediately screen patients. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chest X-ray images; Coronavirus (COVID-19); Deep learning; Radiology images","Diagnosis; Imaging techniques; Object detection; Viruses; Automated detection; Binary classification; Chest X-ray image; Classification accuracy; Devastating effects; Multi-class classification; Object detection systems; Radiological imaging; Deep neural networks",,,,,,,"Wu, F., Zhao, S., Yu, B., A new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in China (2020) Nature, 579 (7798), pp. 265-269; Huang, C., Wang, Y., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 497-506; World Health Organization, Pneumonia of Unknown Cause–China.

Beside clinical procedures and treatments, since Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises a new paradigm for healthcare, several different AI tools that are built upon Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed for analyzing data and decision-making processes. This means that AI-driven tools help identify COVID-19 outbreaks as well as forecast their nature of spread across the globe. However, unlike other healthcare issues, for COVID-19, to detect COVID-19, AI-driven tools are expected to have active learning-based cross-population train/test models that employs multitudinal and multimodal data, which is the primary purpose of the paper. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Active learning; Artificial intelligence; COVID-19; Cross-population train/test models; Machine learning; Multitudinal and multimodal data","active learning; Article; artificial intelligence; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; cross population train; data analysis; epidemic; human; machine learning; medical informatics; nonhuman; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus detection; virus diagnosis; virus pneumonia; algorithm; Coronavirus infection; decision making; epidemic; forecasting; health care delivery; virus pneumonia; COVID-19; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Coronavirus Infections; Decision Making; Delivery of Health Care; Disease Outbreaks; Forecasting; Humans; Machine Learning; Pneumonia, Viral",,"COVID-19",,,,,"Wu, F., Zhao, S., Yu, B., Chen, Y.M., Wang, W., Song, Z.G., Hu, Y., Zhang, Y.Z., A new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in china (2020) Nature, 44 (59), pp. 265-269; (2020) Public Health Response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak – United States, , February 24; Chen, N., Zhou, M., Dong, X., Qu, J., Gong, F., Han, Y., Qiu, Y., Zhang, L., Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in wuhan, china: A descriptive study (2020) The Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 507-513. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/; (2020) Report, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation Report – 49, , https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200229-sitrep-40-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=849d0665_2, accessed March 09, 2020; Wu, Z., McGoogan, J.M., Characteristics of and important lessons from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: Summary of a report of 72,314 cases from the Chinese center for disease control and prevention (2020) JAMA; (2020) The WHO Declares Public Health Emergency for Novel Coronavirus, , https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/924596, January 30; Long, J.B., Ehrenfeld, J.M., The role of augmented intelligence (ai) in detecting and preventing the spread of novel coronavirus (2020) Journal of Medical Systems, 44; Paules, C.I., Marston, H.D., Fauci, A.S., Coronavirus infections – more than just the common cold (2020) JAMA, 323 (8), pp. 707-708; Drosten, C., Gunther, S., Identification of a novel corona virus in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003) N Engl J Med, 348, pp. 1967-1976; Peiris, J., Lai, S., Poon, L., Guan, Y., Yam, L., Lim, W., Nicholls, J., Yuen, K., Coronavirus as a possible cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003) The Lancet, 361 (9366); Song, Z., Xu, Y., Bao, L., Zhang, L., Yu, P., Qu, Y., Zhu, H., Qin, C., From sars to mers, thrusting coronaviruses into the spotlight (2019) Viruses, 11 (1). , https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/11/1/59; de Wit, E., van Doremalen, N., Falzarano, D., Munster, V.J., Sarsandmers: Recentinsights into emerging coronaviruses (2016) Nature Reviews Microbiology, 14 (8), pp. 523-534; Sammut, C., Webb, G.I., (2017) Encyclopedia of Machine Learning and Data Mining, , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4899-7687-1, Springer; Chen, J., Wu, L., Zhang, J., Zhang, L., Gong, D., Zhao, Y., Hu, S., Yu, H., (2020) Deep Learning-Based Model for Detecting 2019 Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia on High-Resolution Computed Tomography: A Prospective Study.

Cardiologia, Ospedale Civile Augusto Murri, Fermo, Italy","The SARS-COVID-19 pandemic is bringing to light significant issues that require deliberations on how to manage patients at high cardiovascular risk or with proven heart disease. The evidence that the hospital can be a place where one might contract the infection and spread the disease has drastically reduced non-COVID-19 accesses to emergency rooms (ER) and to elective non-COVID-19 hospital activities. If this, on one hand, results in reducing improper access to the ER and hospital, on the other hand it substantiates the risk of underestimating problems not connected to COVID-19, such as an increased delay in the diagnosis and treatment of acute myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular emergencies. In addition, the need to reorganize hospital activities to treat patients suffering from serious COVID-19 disease forms forces us to reflect on how to safely manage patients who stay at home with milder COVID-19 disease forms and the need to keep the most vulnerable subjects, such as patients with chronic heart failure, away from the hospital. The problem is furtherly amplified by the uncertain trend of the epidemic, by the duration of forced isolation and limited mobility measures and by the inadequate integration between hospital and territory, especially in high-risk areas such as residences for the elderly or in socially and economically fragile environments. Our opinion is that a syndemic approach, which considers the complex interplay between social, economic, environmental and clinical problems, can be the most appropriate and achieved by means the contribution of telemedicine and telecardiology, intended as integration and not as an alternative to traditional management. A flexible use of telematic tools, now available for teleconsultation, and/or remote monitoring adapted to the needs of clinical, family and social-health contexts could allow the creation of integrated and personalized management programs that are effective and efficient for the care of patients.",,"Betacoronavirus; cardiologist; Coronavirus infection; human; pandemic; risk factor; teleconsultation; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Cardiologists; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Remote Consultation; Risk Factors",,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,19726481,,,"32310921","Italian","G Ital Cardiol (Rome)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083812036

CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old male with AIS A C4 tetraplegia developed fever during the night, without any prodrome. His general practitioner suspected a urinary tract infection and prescribed him antibiotic therapy. After 2 days of antibiotic therapy the fever still persisted, so the individual was admitted to the local hospital and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. After 2 days he was transferred to our spinal unit. Considering the worsening of the chest X-ray and fever despite 48 h of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, we strongly suspected viral pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 was detected and antiviral therapy with Lopinavir/Ritonavir, associated with hydroxychloroquine, was promptly started. Fever ceased after 2 days of therapy. DISCUSSION: Blood test and chest X-ray findings in this patient were similar to previously published findings regarding COVID-19. One difference between this case and the known clinical course of COVID-19 is that did not develop cough. Another interesting feature of our case is that, despite tetraplegia, the clinical course was not severe. Persons with COVID-19 remain asymptomatic, these results underscore the need for rehabilitation and SCI professionals to have a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 in their inpatient and outpatient clients. Only inpatient with fever hase being tested for COVID-19. All new patients are submitted to SARS-COV-2 Test. Moreover, routine testing of patients who have to participate in therapy in common gym areas may be warranted.",,"antiinfective agent; antiretrovirus agent; lopinavir; ritonavir; artificial ventilation; case report; complication; Coronavirus infection; coughing; fever; hospitalization; human; Italy; laboratory technique; male; middle aged; pandemic; quadriplegia; SARS coronavirus; spinal cord injury; virus pneumonia; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Anti-Retroviral Agents; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Cough; Fever; Hospitalization; Humans; Italy; Lopinavir; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quadriplegia; Respiration, Artificial; Ritonavir; SARS Virus; Spinal Cord Injuries",,"lopinavir, 192725-17-0; ritonavir, 155213-67-5; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Anti-Retroviral Agents; Lopinavir; Ritonavir",,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,20586124,,,"32303672","English","Spinal Cord Ser Cases",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083755428

The interference factors causing false-positive reactivity in the two methods were analyzed, and the urea dissociation test was employed to dissociate the SARS-CoV-2 IgM-positive serum using the best dissociation concentration.Results: Two methods detected positive SARS-CoV-2 IgM in 22 middle-high level RF-IgM-positive sera and 14 sera from COVID-19 patients; the other 50 sera were negative. When urea dissociation concentration was 6 mol/L, SARS-CoV-2 IgM were positive in 1 middle-high level RF-IgM-positive sera and in 14 COVID-19 patient sera detected using GICA. When urea dissociation concentration was 4 mol/L and the avidity index (AI) lower than 0.371 was set to negative, SARS-CoV-2 IgM were positive in 3 middle-high level RF-IgM-positive sera and in 14 COVID-19 patient sera detected using ELISA.Conclusion: Middle-high level of RF-IgM could lead to false-positive reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 IgM detected using GICA and ELISA, and urea dissociation tests would be helpful in reducing false-positive results of SARS-CoV-2 IgM.

To contain its spread, China adopted unprecedented nationwide interventions on January 23 2020. These policies included large-scale quarantine, strict controls on travel and extensive monitoring of suspected cases. However, it is unknown whether these policies have had an impact on the epidemic. We sought to show how these control measures impacted the containment of the epidemic. Methods: We integrated population migration data before and after January 23 and most updated COVID-19 epidemiological data into the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model to derive the epidemic curve. We also used an artificial intelligence (AI) approach, trained on the 2003 SARS data, to predict the epidemic. Results: We found that the epidemic of China should peak by late February, showing gradual decline by end of April. A five-day delay in implementation would have increased epidemic size in mainland China three-fold. Lifting the Hubei quarantine would lead to a second epidemic peak in Hubei province in mid-March and extend the epidemic to late April, a result corroborated by the machine learning prediction. Conclusions: Our dynamic SEIR model was effective in predicting the COVID-19 epidemic peaks and sizes. The implementation of control measures on January 23 2020 was indispensable in reducing the eventual COVID-19 epidemic size. © Journal of Thoracic Disease.

Herein, we review the imaging characteristics and computing models that have been applied for the management of COVID-19. CT, positron emission tomography - CT (PET/CT), lung ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been used for detection, treatment, and follow-up. The quantitative analysis of imaging data using artificial intelligence (AI) is also explored. Our findings indicate that typical imaging characteristics and their changes can play crucial roles in the detection and management of COVID-19. In addition, AI or other quantitative image analysis methods are urgently needed to maximize the value of imaging in the management of COVID-19.

Medical imaging such as X-ray and computed tomography (CT) plays an essential role in the global fight against COVID-19, whereas the recently emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies further strengthen the power of the imaging tools and help medical specialists. We hereby review the rapid responses in the community of medical imaging (empowered by AI) toward COVID-19. For example, AI-empowered image acquisition can significantly help automate the scanning procedure and also reshape the workflow with minimal contact to patients, providing the best protection to the imaging technicians. Also, AI can improve work efficiency by accurate delineation of infections in X-ray and CT images, facilitating subsequent quantification. Moreover, the computer-aided platforms help radiologists make clinical decisions, i.e., for disease diagnosis, tracking, and prognosis. In this review paper, we thus cover the entire pipeline of medical imaging and analysis techniques involved with COVID-19, including image acquisition, segmentation, diagnosis, and follow-up. We particularly focus on the integration of AI with X-ray and CT, both of which are widely used in the frontline hospitals, in order to depict the latest progress of medical imaging and radiology fighting against COVID-19.

She was febrile, tachypneic, and hypoxic. Her skin was mottled with 3-s capillary refill, her anterior fontanelle was tense, and she had mute Babinski reflex bilaterally but was moving all extremities. The patient was hyponatremic, thrombocytopenic, and tested positive for influenza A. A computed tomography scan of the brain revealed an acute infarction involving the right frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes in addition to hyperdensities concerning for thrombosed cortical veins. The patient was transferred for specialty evaluation and was discharged 2 weeks later on levetiracetam. Why Should an Emergency Physician be Aware of This?: Pediatric AIS can present with nonspecific symptoms that mimic alternate pathology. A high level of suspicion is needed so as not to miss the diagnosis of pediatric AIS in the emergency department. A thorough neurologic assessment is warranted, and subtle abnormalities should be investigated further. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","cerebrovascular accident; influenza A; ischemic stroke; pediatric stroke; stroke","cefdinir; ceftriaxone; levetiracetam; paracetamol; Article; brain infarction; case report; cerebrovascular accident; clinical article; clinical feature; computer assisted tomography; Coronavirus infection; female; fever; human; infant; influenza A; leukocyte count; otitis media; patent foramen ovale; physical examination; platelet count; priority journal; respiratory syncytial virus infection; seizure; tonic clonic seizure; wheezing",,"cefdinir, 91832-40-5; ceftriaxone, 73384-59-5, 74578-69-1; levetiracetam, 102767-28-2; paracetamol, 103-90-2",,,,,"Carvalho, K.S., Garg, B.P., Arterial strokes in children (2002) Neurol Clin, 20, pp. 1079-1100; Tsze, D.S., Valente, J.H., Pediatric stroke: a review (2011) Emerg Med Int, 2011, p. 734506; Lynch, J.K., Hirtz, D.G., DeVeber, G., Nelson, K.B., Report of the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke workshop on perinatal and childhood stroke (2002) Pediatrics, 109, pp. 116-123; Al-Sulaiman, A., Bademosi, O., Ismail, H., Magboll, G., Stroke in Saudi children (1999) J Child Neurol, 14, pp. 295-298; Bell, M.L., Buchhalter, J.R., Influenza A-associated stroke in a 4-year-old male (2004) Pediatr Neurol, 31, pp. 56-58; Honorat, R., Tison, C., Sevely, A., Cheuret, E., Chaix, Y., Claudet, I., Influenza A (H1N1)-associated ischemic stroke in a 9-month-old child (2012) Pediatr Emerg Care, 28, pp. 368-369; Grau, A.J., Urbanek, C., Palm, F., Common infections and the risk of stroke (2010) Nat Rev Neurol, 6, pp. 681-694; Fullerton, H.J., Hills, N.K., Elkind, M.S., Dowling, M.M., Wintermark, M., Glaser, C.A., Infection, vaccination, and childhood arterial ischemic stroke: results of the VIPS study (2015) Neurology, 85, pp. 1459-1466; Meyer-Heim, A.D., Boltshauser, E., Spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage in children: aetiology, presentation and outcome (2003) Brain Dev, 25, pp. 416-421; Roach, E.S., Lo, W.D., Heyer, G.L., Roach, E.S., Pediatric stroke and cerebrovascular disorders (2012), 3rd ed.

These emerging infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the pandemic influenza A(H1N1) and avian influenza (AI) viruses, have seriously threatened global health and the economy. In particular, MERS-CoV and AI A(H7N9) are still causing infections in several areas, and some clustering of cases of A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) may imply future possible pandemics. Additionally, given the inappropriate use of antibiotics and international travel, the spread of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria is also a significant concern. These infections with epidemic or pandemic potential present a persistent threat to public health and a huge burden on healthcare services in the Asia-Pacific region. Therefore, to enable efficient infection prevention and control, more effective international surveillance and collaboration systems, in the context of the ‘One Health’ approach, are necessary. © 2019 Asian Pacific Society of Respirology","avian influenza; pandemic; respiratory infection; virus","influenza vaccine; severe acute respiratory syndrome vaccine; Asia; avian influenza (H5N1); avian influenza virus; aviation; cluster analysis; disease burden; disease control; disease surveillance; economic aspect; epidemic; geographic distribution; global health; human; influenza A; influenza A (H7N9); intermethod comparison; life threat; Middle East respiratory syndrome; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; nonhuman; One Health; Pacific islands; priority journal; public health; respiratory tract infection; Review; SARS-related coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; contact examination; epidemic; infection control; microbiology; organization and management; procedures; respiratory tract infection; virology; Asia; Contact Tracing; Epidemics; Global Health; Humans; Infection Control; Public Health; Respiratory Tract Infections",,,,,,,"Kotsimbos, T., Waterer, G., Jenkins, C., Kelly, P.M., Cheng, A., Hancox, R.J., Holmes, M., Irving, L., (2010), Influenza A/H1N1_09 Australia and New Zealand's winter of discontent., Am.

In this paper, we analyzed the transmission route of MERS-CoV with a novel molecular approach. We collected the amino acid sequence of MERS-CoV from 15 different regions, which were then analyzed with Neural Network and Support Vector Machine. With the usage of artificial intelligence algorithms, while there was a failure on extracting a rule which can distinguish each virus and figuring out the transmission route, the common features of the sequences were detected. As a result, we could justify the previously studied result on the transmission route. During the procedure, we investigated the basic cause of the failure in consideration of the principle of the algorithms used, and suggested a better path of analysis using artificial intelligence applied to epidemiological studies. © 2017 Global IT Research Institute - GiRI.","Epidemiological investigation; MERS; Middle east respiratory syndrome; Neural network; Support vector machine; Transmission route","Artificial intelligence; Neural networks; Viruses; Amino acid sequence; Artificial intelligence algorithms; Epidemiological investigation; Epidemiological studies; Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; MERS; Middle East; Transmission route; Support vector machines",,,,,,,"De Groot, R.J., Baker, S.C., Baric, R.S., Brown, C.S., Drosten, C., Enjuanes, L., Fouchier, R.A., Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV): Announcement of the Coronavirus Study Group (2013) J Virol, 87, pp. 7790-7792; Ki, M., (2015) 2015 MERS Outbreak in Korea: Hospital-to-hospital Transmission, 37, p. e2015033; (2015) Summary of Current Situation, Literature Update and Risk Assessment, , WHO WHO/MERS/RA/15.1; Azhar, E.I., El-Kafrawy, S.A., Farraj, S.A., Hassan, A.M., Al-Saeed, M.S., Hashem, A.M., Madani, T.A., Evidence for camel-to-human transmission of mers coronavirus (2014) N Engl J Med 2014, 370, pp. 2499-2505; Cotten, M., Watson, S.J., Zumla, A.I., Makhdoom, H.Q., Palser, A.L., Ong, S.H., Al Rabeeah, A.A., Memish, Z.A., Spread, circulation, and evolution of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (2014) MBio, pp. 01062-01113; Kim, D., Hong, S., Choi, S., Yoon, T., Analysis of transmission route of mers coronavirus using decision tree and apriori algorithm (2016) 2016 18th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT); Zaki, A.M., Van Boheemen, S., Bestebroer, T.M., Osterhaus, A.D., Fouchier, R.A., Isolation of a novel coronavirus from a man with pneumonia in Saudi Arabia (2012) N Engl J Med, 367 (19), pp. 1814-1820; Durai, P., Batool, M., Shah, M., Choi, S., Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus: Transmission, Virology and Therapeutic Targeting to Aid in Outbreak Control; Mers-Cov Research G State of knowledge and data gaps of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in humans PLoS Curr, , Who; Woo, P.C., Lau, S.K., Li, K.S., Tsang, A.K., Yuen, K.Y., Genetic relatedness of the novel human group C betacoronavirus to Tylonycteris batcoronavirus HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5 (2012) Emerg Microbes Infect, 1, p. e35; Kayali, G., Peiris, M., A more detailed picture of the epidemiology of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (2015) Lancet Infect Dis, 15, pp. 495-497; Milne-Price, S., Miazgowicz, K.L., Munster, V.J., The emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (2014) Pathog Dis, 71, pp. 121-136; Xia, S., Liu, Q., Wang, Q., Sun, Z., Su, S., Du, L., Ying, T., Jiang, S., Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) entry inhibitors targeting spike protein (2014) Virus Res, 194, pp. 200-210; Cortes, C., Vapnik, V., Support-vector networks (1995) Machine Learning, 20 (3), pp. 273-297. , doi:10.1007/BF00994018",,,"Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI);et al.;Gangwon Convention and Visitors Bureau;IEEE Communication Society (IEEE ComSOc);Korean Institute of Communication Sciences (KICS);National Information Society Agency (NIA)","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","19th International Conference on Advanced Communications Technology, ICACT 2017","19 February 2017 through 22 February 2017",,127106,17389445,9788996865094,,,"English","Int.

The mortality rates in the investigated flocks ranged from 1 to 47%. Results showed that mixed infection represented 66.3% of the examined flocks. Mixed infectious bronchitis (IBV) and avian influenza (AI)-H9N2 viruses were the most common infection (41.7%). Lack of AI-H9N2 vaccination and high rates of mixed infections in which AI-H9N2 is involved indicate an early AI-H9N2 infection with a potential immunosuppressive effect that predisposes for other viral infections. High pathogenic AI-H5N1 and virulent Newcastle disease virus (vNDV) infections were also detected (26.7% and 8.1%, respectively). Interestingly, co-infection of AI-H9N2 with either AIV-H5N1 or vNDV rarely resulted in high mortality. Partial cell-mediated immunity against similar internal AI genes, as well as virus interference between AI and vNDV, could be an explanation for this. Highly prevalent IBV and AI-H9N2 were isolated and were molecularly characterized based on S1 gene hypervariable region 3 (HVR3) and hemagglutinin gene (HA) sequences, respectively. IBV strains were related to the variant group of IBV with multiple mutations in HVR3. Though AI-H9N2 viruses showed low rate of evolution in comparison to recent strains, few amino acid substitutions indicative of antibody selection pressure were observed in the HA gene. In conclusion, mixed viral infections, especially with IBV and AI-H9N2 viruses, are the predominant etiology of respiratory disease problems in broiler chickens in Egypt. Further investigations of the role of AI, IBV, and ND viruses' co-infections and interference in terms of altering the severity of clinical signs and lesions and/or generating novel reassortants within each virus are needed. © 2016 Poultry Science Association Inc.","chicken; Egypt; H9N2; infectious bronchitis; respiratory outbreaks","viral protein; amino acid sequence; animal; Avian infectious bronchitis virus; chicken; Coinfection; Coronavirus Infections; Egypt; genetics; Influenza A virus (H5N1); Influenza A virus (H9N2); Influenza in Birds; mortality; Newcastle disease; Newcastle disease virus; phylogeny; physiology; polymerase chain reaction; Poultry Diseases; prevalence; veterinary; virology; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Chickens; Coinfection; Coronavirus Infections; Egypt; Infectious bronchitis virus; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza A Virus, H9N2 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Newcastle Disease; Newcastle disease virus; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Poultry Diseases; Prevalence; Viral Proteins",,"Viral Proteins",,,,,"Abdel-Moneim, A.S., Afifi, M.A., El-Kady, M.F., Emergence of a novel genotype of avian infectious bronchitis virus in Egypt (2012) Arch.

This study investigated the effects of different types of immune stress on growth performance, immunity, and the distribution of cecal microflora in broiler chickens. In total, 540 oneday- old Cobb 500 broilers were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 5 (n = 108 birds/group) treatments: 1) no vaccination; 2) simplified vaccination, which included the infectious bronchitis vaccine (H120), the inactivated avian influenza vaccine (AI), the live vaccine strain Clone-30 of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and the combined inactive vaccine for infectious bursal diseases and the Newcastle disease vaccine (ND-IB); 3) normal vaccination (simplified vaccination + second dose of ND-IB, H120, and AI); 4) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stress (normal vaccination+LPS); or 5) cyclophosphamide (CPM) stress (normal vaccination+CPM).The results showed that the average BW and average feed intake decreased significantly after treatment with LPS or CPM (P < 0.05). Chickens that were challenged by LPS or CPM had a lower ileal CP digestibility than that of the control group (P < 0.01). Compared with the control group, the levels of secreted IgA decreased significantly at 42 d of age in the chickens that were treated with LPS or CPM (P < 0.01). The proliferation of the peripheral blood mononuclear cell and the levels of serum IgG in the LPS-challenged chickens were higher than those in the control group chickens at 21 and 42 d of age, respectively (P < 0.05). Six clusters were identified at 21 d of age, but cluster 6 was a single sample. Only 5 clusters were identified at 42 d of age. The enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR fingerprints of the cecal samples from the no vaccination and the simplified vaccination groups clustered together with high coefficients. The ERICPCR fingerprints of the 3 cecal samples from the CPM and LPS treatment groups clustered together with high coefficients among them. The ERIC-PCR fingerprints of the microbial flora of the cecal contents revealed the potential effects of immune stress on the microbial populations of treated birds. These data suggest that broilers with simplified vaccinations or without vaccinations can achieve the same growth performance as broilers with general vaccinations, but immune stress can break the homeostasis of cecal microflora and impair intestinal mucosal immune function. © 2011 Poultry Science Association Inc.","Cecal microflora; Chicken; Growth performance; Immune stress; Immunity","cyclophosphamide; immunosuppressive agent; lipopolysaccharide; virus vaccine; animal; animal disease; article; Avian infectious bronchitis virus; birnavirus infection; cecum; chicken; clinical trial; cluster analysis; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; Enterobacteriaceae; genetics; growth, development and aging; immunology; infectious bursal disease virus; microbiology; Newcastle disease; Newcastle disease paramyxovirus; randomized controlled trial; virology; Animals; Birnaviridae Infections; Cecum; Chickens; Cluster Analysis; Coronavirus Infections; Cyclophosphamide; Enterobacteriaceae; Immunosuppressive Agents; Infectious bronchitis virus; Infectious bursal disease virus; Lipopolysaccharides; Newcastle Disease; Newcastle disease virus; Viral Vaccines; Aves; Enterobacteriaceae; Gallus gallus; Newcastle disease virus",,"cyclophosphamide, 50-18-0; Cyclophosphamide, 50-18-0; Immunosuppressive Agents; Lipopolysaccharides; Viral Vaccines",,,"Central University Basic Scientific Research Business Expenses Special Funds

Our objective was to evaluate the effects of these infections on general health and reproduction parameters measurable on herd level and to explore the association between antibody status and some herd characteristics.Methods: We collected a pooled milk sample from five primiparous cows from 79 Swedish dairy herds in September 2006. The samples were analysed for immunoglobulin G antibodies to BCV and BRSV with indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Herd level data from 1 September 2005 to 30 August 2006 were accessed retrospectively. The location of the herds was mapped using a geographical information system.Results: Ten herds were antibody negative to both viruses and were compared with 69 herds positive to BCV or BRSV or both. Positive herds had a higher (P = 0.001) bulk tank milk somatic cell count (BMSCC) compared with negative herds. The medians for all other analyzed health and reproductive parameters were consistently in favour of the herds negative to both viruses although the differences were not statistically significant. A higher proportion (P = 0.01) of herds used professional technicians for artificial insemination, rather than farm personnel, amongst the 33 herds negative to BCV compared with the 46 positive herds.Conclusions: Our result shows that herds that were antibody positive to BCV and/or BRSV had a higher BMSCC compared with herds negative to BCV and BRSV. There was also tendency that negative herds had a better general herd health compared with positive. A higher proportion amongst the BCV negative herds used external technicians for AI instead of farm personnel, indicating that it is possible to avoid infection although having regular visits. Negative herds were located in close proximity to positive herds, indicating that local spread and airborne transmission between herds might not be of great importance and that herds can stay free from these infection transmission although virus is circulating in the area. © 2010 Ohlson et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Bos; Bovinae; Bovine coronavirus; Bovine respiratory syncytial virus; Coronavirus; Respiratory syncytial virus; immunoglobulin G; virus antibody; animal; animal disease; article; artificial insemination; cattle; cattle disease; cell count; Coronavirus; Coronavirus infection; dairying; disease transmission; female; immunology; milk; paramedical personnel; pathophysiology; physiology; reproduction; Respiratory syncytial pneumovirus; respiratory syncytial virus infection; retrospective study; Sweden; Animal Technicians; Animals; Antibodies, Viral; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Cell Count; Coronavirus Infections; Coronavirus, Bovine; Dairying; Female; Immunoglobulin G; Insemination, Artificial; Milk; Reproduction; Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections; Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Bovine; Retrospective Studies; Sweden",,"immunoglobulin G, 97794-27-9; Antibodies, Viral; Immunoglobulin G",,,,,"Clark, M.A., Bovine coronavirus (1993) Br Vet J, 149, pp. 51-70; Valarcher, J.F., Taylor, G., Bovine respiratory syncytial virus infection (2007) Vet Res, 38, pp. 153-180. , 10.1051/vetres:2006053, 17257568; Stair, E.L., Rhodes, M.B., White, R.G., Mebus, C.A., Neonatal calf diarrhea: purification and electron microscopy of a coronavirus-like agent (1972) Am J Vet Res, 33, pp. 1147-1156; Saif, L.J., A review of evidence implicating bovine coronavirus in the etiology of winter dysentery in cows: an enigma resolved?

Screening to detect potential SARS-infected subjects with elevated body temperature plays an important role in preventing the spread of SARS. Thermography is being used with ANN/AI to analyse the data collected from the designated SARS hospital in Singapore, and conclusive results are drawn. The current work evaluates the correlations (and classifications) between facial skin temperatures, including eye range and forehead, to aural temperature using a neural network (NN) approach, namely training backpropagation (BP) and Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM), to confirm the suitability of thermal imagers for human temperature screening. Both BP and SOM can form an opinion about the type of network that is better able to complement thermogram technology in fever diagnosis. This can produce better parameters for reducing the size of the NN classifier, while maintaining good classification accuracy. We observe that BP performs better than SOM NN. Confusion matrix (CM), an alternative display instrument, is able to process a high volume of input data and show the clustered output rapidly and accurately. The current research application will remain an interesting and useful reference for both local and overseas manufacturers of thermal scanners, users and various government and private establishments. As the elevation of body temperature is a common presenting symptom for many illnesses, including infectious diseases such as SARS, thermal imagers are useful and essential tools for mass screening of body temperature. This is true not only for SARS but also during other public health crises where widespread transmission of infection such as the danger of avian flu pandemic is a concern, in particular at places like hospitals and cross-border checkpoints. © 2006 Informa UK Ltd.",,"Confusion matrix (CM); Cross-border checkpoints; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS); Backpropagation; Conformal mapping; Display devices; Neural networks; Self organizing maps; Thermography (imaging); Pulmonary diseases; accuracy; article; artificial neural network; clinical feature; cluster analysis; confusion; controlled study; correlation analysis; disease classification; female; fever; government; human; human experiment; information processing; learning; male; medical assessment; medical education; medical instrumentation; medical research; screening test; severe acute respiratory syndrome; skin temperature; thermography; Body Temperature; Disease Outbreaks; Eye; Female; Fever; Forehead; Humans; Male; Mass Screening; Neural Networks (Computer); Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Thermography",,,,,,,"(1998) Japanese Standards JIS T1141: Medical Infrared Thermographs; (1997) ASTM E1862-97 Standard Test Method for Measuring and Compensating for Reflected Temperature Using Infrared Imaging Radiometers; (1998) ASTM E1965-98 Standard Specification for Infrared Thermometers for Intermittent Determination of Patient Temperature; Wiecek, B., Zwolenik, Z., Thermal wave method - Limits and potentialities of active thermography in biology and medicine (2002) Thermology International, 12, p. 155; Wiecek, B., Zwolenik, S., Danych, R., Thermal wave method and thermography - Basis and applications (2001) Thermology International, 11, p. 78; Wiecek, B., Zwolenik, S., Jung, A., Zuber, J., Advanced thermal, visual and radiological image processing for clinical diagnosis (1998) European Journal of Thermology, 8, pp. 139-144; Blackwell, T., SARS scanners praised as placebo (2003) Canada National Post, , 24 September 2003; Pre-Assessment: The Use of Thermal Imaging Device in Screening for Fever 2003, , http://www.ccohta.ca, Available online; Niel, V.M., Jonah, H., Airport SARS screener defective (2003) The Manila Times, , 17 May 2003; Ragesh, S., Checkpoints' thermal scanners unsuitable (2003) The Malaysian Berita Harian, , 24 May 2003; Our neighbor is not serious in containing SARS (2003) The Malaysian Berita Harian, , 26 May; Heusch, A.I., McCaffery, C., McCarthy, P.W., Cooling curves: Is time important?

In general, viruses tend to be restricted to the natural host species which they infect. From time to time viruses cross the host-range barrier expanding their host range. However, in very rare cases cross-species transfer is followed by the establishment and persistence of a virus in the new host species, which may result in disease. Recent examples of viruses that have crossed the species barrier from animal reservoirs to humans are hantavirus, haemorrhagic fever viruses, arboviruses, Nipah and Hendra viruses, avian influenza virus (AI), monkeypox virus, and the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The opportunities for cross-species transfer of mammalian viruses have increased in recent years due to increased contact between humans and animal reservoirs. However, it is difficult to predict when such events will take place since the viral adaptation that is needed to accomplish this is multifactorial and stochastic. Against this background the intensified use of viruses and their genetically modified variants as viral gene transfer vectors for biomedical research, experimental gene therapy and for live-vector vaccines is a cause for concern. This review addresses a number of potential risk factors and their implications for activities with viral vectors from the perspective of cross-species transfer of viruses in nature, with emphasis on the occurrence of host-range mutants resulting from either cell culture or tropism engineering. The issues are raised with the intention to assist in risk assessments for activities with vector viruses.

However, only 6% died. Within the first week after inoculation (AI), we noted a panencephalitis. Prominent demyelination detected in the spinal cord on day 6 continued through day 29 AI. Demyelinated lesions in the spinal cord were either subpial with few inflammatory cells except for macrophages or perivascular with prominent accumulation of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages. Beginning on day 6 AI, IgG was detected in the lesions. Although an infectious virus was detectable in the CNS only through day 12 AI, viral antigen expression continued through day 24.
